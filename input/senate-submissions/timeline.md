First reports of the app interacting poorly with other Bluetooth devices (e.g. Continuous Glucose Monitors).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| 4   | 30/04/2020 | First contact with Singapore OpenTrace team. TempID caching issue fixed same-day. The Singapore team confirms that iPhones in the background are “not expected to work”.  ASD confirmed that they will “follow this up”. No further contact.  The Cybersecurity CRC confirmed that they have forwarded this doc but are extremely dismissive of the findings. No further contact. Maddocks replied and promised to forward the doc. No further contact.                                                               |
| 8   | 04/05/2020 | First contact with DTA. v1.0.15 & v1.0.16 (Android) released containing only updates to graphics and animations and some minor text changes. The only issue fixed is the confusing wording raised by Geoff. risky.biz <a href="https://risky.biz/covidsafeissues/">publishes a high-level summary</a> of the known issues at this stage.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 9   | 05/05/2020 | v1.1 (iPhone) released. DTA confirms that they were first aware of the issues on 30/04/2020, but our contact still had not read the document.

| 17  | 13/05/2020 | DTA confirms that there will be a release tomorrow to fix the iPhone crash but it will fix none of the outstanding privacy issues.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 18  | 14/05/2020 | v1.0.17 (Android) and v1.2 (iPhone) released. Contrary to advice from the day before, fixes the first two privacy issues (along with the remote iPhone crash). DTA asked (via SMS to Jim Mussared) for availability to discuss fixes for CVE-2020-12586 in the next couple of days. Jim offered that they can call any time, but then they never followed through on arranging a time. No further contact received from the DTA, all follow-up emails ignored.
