Taradb|27/04/2020|Let‚Äôs work together and do what it takes|When so much is at stake in terms of lives livelihoods all aspects of wellbeing and quality of life I feel that downloading this app is the least that I can do. I am confident the limited data collected will not be misused and I found the app itself to be really quick and straightforward to download and set up. One of the other reviewers said to omit the ‚Äò0‚Äô when entering mobile numbers to fit with the international dialling format. Maybe this is why I did not experience the same issues as a few others. In any case it is great to see so many people being proactive about downloading this app. Please let‚Äôs all work together and do whatever it takes to beat the coronavirus look after our communities and help restore health to all aspects of our beautiful nation.|
Guy Aus|27/04/2020|Doing my bit to Stop the spread. Easy Fast Reassuring.|I‚Äôm a sceptic when it comes to government apps but I read the Privacy Policy and felt reassured that I could use a fake name only asked for my age range postcode and phone number. I was reassured my location is not tracked or recorded and it‚Äôs deleted every 21 days. The app only works on Bluetooth signal strength vicinity to record distance from potential infected people. Reassured and feel like I‚Äôm doing my bit for my friends family and country co I can be contacted ASAP if I came close to anyone who ends up infected. Brilliant bit or technology actually. I turn off at night when I‚Äôm sleeping into ‚ÄòAirplane Mode‚Äô so it not emitting signals while I sleep.|If you‚Äôre an Aussie and care you‚Äôd download it too and delete this app in a month or so when this all blows over! üòúüçª|
Lightning!72!|26/04/2020|No problems signing up|Those saying they can‚Äôt get their number recognised have you tried leaving off the leading zero? Because the app has the +61 at the front this usually means you enter your phone number without the leading zero. I imagine they‚Äôve put the 61 there to ensure that only Australian numbers can participate which is sensible. I left off the leading zero and got in straight away with no issues at all.|I think this app is a great initiative. I‚Äôm not worried about the so called problems of authorities knowing where I am. They can already do that anyway through the phone‚Äôs location service and through the gps on my car. This is designed for better tracing of who you happen to be around in the shops or at work or wherever to meet the response to the virus so I‚Äôll support it.|
brass razoo|26/04/2020|Installed perfectly on iPhone|I have an Apple iPhone X running iOS 13.4.1|I downloaded the app from from the App Store and installed without any problems at all.|There is a small glitch which is after you enter your mobile phone number as well as the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô button the ‚Äòverily phone number‚Äô text was also showing however the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô was much more obvious and when pressed I received my PIN number immediately.|As the app has +61 there is no need to enter the first zero of your phon number.|We all need to be even more aware of safe actions and behaviours now some restrictions are being eased. So please install the app and use it.|To all those who flocked to Bondi and other beaches against instructions did you know the Governor of New York has said the major|reason New York as such a massive death toll compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles is that New York introduced lock-down and social distancing 1 week later.|Only 1 week made a difference of thousands of deaths so please use the app follow the rules and was your hands (properly) with soap and water.|May we all emerge safe and well however we must all do the right thing.|
Ally_K87|27/04/2020|Let‚Äôs save lives!|Less than 30 seconds to install and register.|If you have ever had anything to do with Aus Gov they already have more info than this app provides them with. I used a pseudonym no problem.|It doesn‚Äôt ask to use your location services (so no it‚Äôs not a ‚Äòtracking app‚Äô) it only uses Bluetooth signals to ping off other app users (that‚Äôs why it asks you to keep app running in background and Bluetooth on).|You enter your mobile number so if a user is diagnosed and they upload their data which has used Bluetooth to ping other users (in close proximity for more than 15mins) by putting our mobile numbers in it allows the health dept. to be able to contact us not by using a location service.|If you have any app on your phone that uses location services it‚Äôs more invasive than this one.|You have to upload your data for it to be accessible otherwise it is kept on your phone.|Even if it did use location services (which it doesn‚Äôt) I‚Äôd rather give access to the govt of my location for a couple of months than potentially be in ICU or be responsible for someone else being in ICU.|

AQ4/48|30/04/2020|Seems working OK but needs Apple Watch Capability|I installed the app it was easy to install and seems working OK but since the app doesn‚Äôt give live feedback to the user due to the privacy of other users there is no practical way to know if it is working as it should be.|My main concern and suggestion is that it only works on the phone and not on the watch. Phones are not easy to sanitise each time you go out and come back that is why whenever I go grocery shopping i only have my Apple Watch with me since I can have my calls texts and payments with it and I can wash it while washing my hands when I come home. Therefore my phone shows no contact with anyone.|
Andro1|01/05/2020|Keeps asking me to register every day|I am using this on my new iPad as I don‚Äôt use a smartphone. Not sure what the problem is but every morning the app is asking me to input my information and register again even though I successfully registered and got the screen saying I do not need to do anything further. I am not sure how but eventually if I close the app a few times and reopen it it gives me the screen showing I am already registered and the pulsating shield screen. If this keeps happening I will delete it in a few days. Can‚Äôt find anywhere to send feedback to directly or get any support so I hope someone is reading these feedbacks. The APP SUPPORT BUTTON just takes you to a faq page with no contact details re: the app so that is useless. Also the frequent notifications about running the app are pointless and really annoying. This was obviously a rush job stupidly.|
Sky Velleity|10/05/2020|Update: Technically Competent still unnecessarily invasive|After testing the latest update I have found that it is at very least on a technical level functional.|It still unnecessarily stores user data on a server uses keys which are not truly anonymous and transmits your device model publicly.|Once decentralised key exchange replaces the current system either by an independent update or by the implementation of the system in production by Apple and Google I will update this to five stars.|For the time being I would also like an update so that tracing can be temporary disabled from within the app without having to revoke it‚Äôs permissions or turn off bluetooth entirely as there is no point leaving tracking enabled when I am separated from my phone.|
timmalone|01/05/2020|Good idea but...|...not very clear how it‚Äôs actually implemented. The notification sent every morning implies you need the app open on your screen to be effective. Why not take a little extra time to develop something that works in the background? Sure millions might download but if it‚Äôs a requirement to keep it open and few do it‚Äôs not gonna help much.|Also the daily notification is annoying. When I turned notifications off the app implied it would no longer work without it. Want to help but do I really need a notification every morning to do so?|Minus one star for each of the above but 3 stars for: a simple on boarding process; a clean design; and for getting it out quickly. Hoping it still works in the background!|
MyNameIs-URL|13/05/2020|It runs in the background|Some people appear to believe the app must remain active on the screen in order for it to work. Just open the app after you've registered and leave it running in the background. You can use other apps without issue. You'll forget it is even there.|As annoying as the morning notifications is just be assured it is to remind you to check if it is still open in the background and active. I don't always check each morning and neither do you just make sure it is open in the background every so often. No big deal.|
jahejebbd|04/05/2020|My personal review|I agree to many Australians that this app is fantastic it doesn‚Äôt use up battery it does locate where you are but it‚Äôs for our safety which I hope you all completely understand. This app will locate where you are so when they find someone who does have COVID 19 they will see who they where close by to and have a look at the location but that is all. I hope that many Australians get this app so that our lives can go back to normal soon the more people getting the app the closer we get to a healthier and happier life. When everything was our everyday life!|
Kvishal|27/04/2020|A really focused contact tracing app|Just installed this. If you are in Australia please install it too.|For anyone with concerns about privacy from a technical perspective this saves Far Less data than Facebook or Google Maps. It also only saves nearby phones if you have been together for 15 mins. And without GPS it doesn‚Äôt provide hotspot data. It also does not continuously send data instead doing a download of positive cases.|Overall it‚Äôs extremely limited compared to what‚Äôs being hyped. Still some mechanism to be alerted to being at risk is better than nothing. Please install.|
KvaziReviewer|26/04/2020|Not working well not privacy friendly|This app has failed in two ways. First you need to have this app always running with your phone fully unlocked all the time to make it work. This is how iOS was designed to prevent privacy abuse apps in background do not get a change to always broadcast data via bluetooth.|The government had a chance to avoid this problem because Apple and Google are coming up with their own contact tracing solution that they could implement in this app (Contact Tracing framework) but the government decided not to use it.|Secondly they ask you to provide your contact details at the point of the registration. They could do that when you are notified about contacting someone with the virus instead. There is no real reason to collect this information for every single person and store it on a server.|
Zeus1974|14/05/2020|Daily Notifications|I realise that until Apple and Google release their contract tracing API the only way for COVIDSafe to work is to remain the active app. But sending a daily reminder notification in the morning will quickly make non-technical users ignore/discard notifications from this app.|I am assuming COVIDSafe will use Apple's contact tracing API otherwise I don't know many iPhone users who will regularly use the app. If this is the case please use notifications sparingly at the moment because they will become critical in the future. Notifications should only be used to alert you to possible exposure that requires an immediate test.|Please don't make us numb to notifications before the real contact tracing capability exists!|
AconnectJS|27/04/2020|Save someone‚Äôs life|I think this app is a great Inititive. For the fearful...If it proves to take away your privacy delete it. Ironically this APP will give back some freedoms. By the way; I have an IT company. If you own a device that can download this app than you can already be tracked but there is not a big computer in the sky trying to figure out your every move they only want to sell you something....read google androids and apples terms and conditions. You have already given up those rights before you downloaded this APP. But this APP will save lives! Get behind it. Support each other.|
AdamB-GC|26/04/2020|Easy to setup|I see many people saying they can‚Äôt get the app to work because they can‚Äôt verify their mobile number. I had no trouble with my setup. The app did throw up an error when I entered the first 4 digits of my mobile number starting with 0414 but if I just entered 414 (No zero as the first digit) and then entered the rest of the numbers it verified and sent me a pin # to enter on my iPhone. If you tried imputing your mobile number without the first zero and it didn‚Äôt work then I would assume it was an overload error on the server with this app currently ranking as the #1 downloaded app in the Apple App Store.|
Julie in FItzroy|27/04/2020|Very simple to download and quick to register|I‚Äôm all set up ... whoo hooü•≥. This marvellous app was very simple to download and quick to register. I hope EVERYONE downloads it as it will keep us all safe AND ALIVE. I am satisfied the Australian Government has diligently built in all the checks and balances to make this site secure - even though we only have to enter the most basic information so we can be contacted if we unknowingly come into contact with a ‚Äòcarrier‚Äô of the deadly virus. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. üíêüíêüíêüôèüôèüôèüëçüëçüëç|* I would not be surprised in the least if other countries struggling to stop the carnage adopted this app.|
AnyonymousReviewer12|06/05/2020|Suggestion|I know this app serves a great purpose; but it would extend the functionality and greatly improve some people‚Äôs experience of this app if you (the developers) create an Apple Watch app; since I exercise frequently outside without my phone and always have my Watch on me. The Watch is always on Bluetooth which I know is the main method of connection to other devices.|Also occasionally usually some mornings I have gotten a notification on my iPhone 11 that says I need to reopen COVIDSafe I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs what it means but it may be an issue.|Other than that all great!|
TrumpMushroo|06/05/2020|Wayyy too many notifications!! Tone it down or it goes.|Great app so far. Love the design and the idea. HOWEVER if the app doesn‚Äôt stop sending me notifications every day I‚Äôm going to delete it. I don‚Äôt mind getting notifications once a week if there‚Äôs anything important I need to know but don‚Äôt bug me every single day with useless information. Learn how users react to notification spam. When you annoy people you lose goodwill and they WILL delete it. That‚Äôs not a chance you should be taking with such an important app. The only notifications I should be getting are (A) if my Bluetooth is off and the app won‚Äôt work properly or (B) there‚Äôs important news that I need to know. That‚Äôs it. Please don‚Äôt make me delete this app. It‚Äôs not hard to fix!|
darkDancer82|01/05/2020|Needs "Background App Refresh"|I've deleted this junk app. It doesn't function correctly. I don't want notifications on period! Bluetooth Sharing is a security risk like writing your password down on paper and putting it on display in a public place. Other apps have been able to successfully implement "Background App Refresh" without the app having to be open or running in the tray. Many times I've left the house or gone to the shops I always forget to make sure it's running mainly because it's not an app I actively use. Set and Forget would be best for this app to function. Apple have integrated Covid-19 support in an upcoming update which therefore make this app redundant. There is a slim chance you will find this working when passing another person with it running as you've designed.|
AndyInOz187|28/04/2020|6+ activation attempts WI-FI OFF solved it|I am a fairly savvy iPhone user and app installer using an iPhone SE and it took me many attempts to get it activated. Firstly it refused to accept my 9 digit mobile number (leading zero removed) then after finally accepting it it would not send me an SMS message the first time then it would not accept my pin when entered in a timely way then it refused to resend me a new pin. I restarted my phone a few times along to way which sometimes helped to get a little further. Eventually I TURNED OFF MY MOBILE‚ÄôS WI-FI to force it to use 4G then I re-did the activation steps and it all worked perfectly and very quickly. My gut feel is this app may be happier authenticating and activating when using the phone‚Äôs 4G connection (not Wi-Fi).|
San1304|01/05/2020|‚ÄúWe need you‚Äù EDITED|Every day! The app annoys me by saying ‚ÄúWe need you‚Äù I downloaded the app so I‚Äôd be advised if I‚Äôd been in contact with someone who had the virus but the daily message is really annoying especially as when I go in to the app it says ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt need to do anything else‚Äù. Developers please note- if you continue to annoy me I will delete the app. EDIT - ok I get it now. You open the app & leave it open. The Bluetooth is only active if your phone is unlocked & by opening the app your phone won‚Äôt auto-lock after 5 minutes (or whatever your setting is). But if it sends me another message tomorrow ........|
Lion369700|26/04/2020|Good but why do I need a phone number|I think this is a very good app but why do I need to verify the phone number can I just put the number in or out an email a lot of kids don‚Äôt have a phone number so it stops them from getting the app it should just tell you in the app if you have come in close contact with someone with it or make the phone number optional there are also a lot of people having issues with the phone number option so please remove the phone number or make it an in app notification or email.|
Unity.Productions|13/05/2020|Great potential but needs more improvement|So I‚Äôm not sure how to review this there‚Äôs nothing to show the user what‚Äôs happening. Just for the innovation of this to track diseases spread it gets 3 stars from me can be really helpful. However need to show status what‚Äôs happening? What‚Äôs the app doing? What information is it collecting? Also give user control setting what personal information is stored. Also every once in a while it gives an alert ‚Äúcheck if coronasafe app is active‚Äù I‚Äôm sure this can be automated to check if it is active or not and only give alert if it‚Äôs not. Also run in the background to conserve power. But has a lot of potential.|
Loon-i-Tunes|07/05/2020|Remove pointless notifications|Every day or so when sitting at home I get a notification on my lock screen but upon opening the app the notification is either a reminder to keep the app working in the background and Bluetooth on when in meetings and out in public or there appears to be no actual reason for the notification at all.|I‚Äôm keeping the app and Bluetooth on so the reminder seems pointless and annoying.|Please ensure if we get notifications from the App that there is a valid reason for us to investigate what it wants to tell us.|
wartermalone|29/04/2020|Let‚Äôs do this!|Installation and registration fine / no issues on iPhone X. It would be good if the user themselves could get stats / feedback such as number of interactions with other people with the app / how close you were to another user and how long. Just so you know it is working properly and can also make sure you can adjust your social distancing if required etc. apart from that everyone should download privacy reasons touted by some are nonsense. Google Apple FB and the ATO have way for info on you so stop worrying|
itsrenatak|27/04/2020|Great App for COVID tracking Doesn‚Äôt work on an iPhone in the Background|I downloaded this app but soon deleted it when I read online that for it to actually work you need to have it open all the time on your iPhone and you need to have your iPhone unlocked and have the app always on and it apparently chews up battery life on an iPhone leaving it open. It is easy to register to get in the app and it gives you a PIN number over text message to verify in the app for it to load your details you submitted. I read it will notify you when the pandemic is over to delete the app on notifications or maybe text message.|
SelonQui|27/04/2020|Needs to be a little clearer|The government‚Äôs contact tracing app seems fine but there‚Äôs a hiccup with the blue button at the bottom you can press to send your data to the health authorities when requested.|The app designers have (I assume) assumed that you will only press this button if you test positive to covid-19 so the first thing it says is ‚Äúyou have tested positive for covid-19‚Äù.|Facebook is already awash with misunderstandings about how the app works and what it does so I‚Äôll be curious to see whether there are edge cases wherein people see this and assume that there‚Äôs a database somewhere showing them as infected.|
robdae|01/05/2020|Seems kinda pointless|I understand the need for this app but it seems a little pointless. As I‚Äôm as hearing to the social distancing regulations the only people who I‚Äôm ever in contact with for more than 15 minutes are the people in my house. The most likely place I‚Äôm going to contact this virus is while shopping and the people I pass in the shops won‚Äôt be registered. The serving problem with it is Bluetooth which I need to remember to turn on when I leave the house but turn off at home or my phone automatically connects to random home devices.|
A_Brisbane|13/05/2020|Notifications|The app currently says it‚Äôs not active if notifications are turned off. My understanding was that the app itself won‚Äôt notify if any close contact with confirmed cases however that a phone call would still be the method of notification. I‚Äôm receiving daily notifications from the app that are annoying. I would hope these notifications are minimised OR the app is ‚Äòactive‚Äô without notifications being turned on. Happy to have the app running on my phone but not happy to have frequent unwarranted notifications|
jazzyM6545|09/05/2020|A necessity but annoying daily notifications|I believe in the concept of this app but the daily alert to keep Bluetooth and locations on is tedious. It‚Äôs also confusing for elderly who then think it‚Äôs telling them to do something and maybe they‚Äôve accidentally turned it off so spend ages checking everything. Please please get rid of that it‚Äôs not necessary and it s really making me want to turn off notifications which defeats the purpose. You want ppl to keep the app with notifications on then don‚Äôt send repetitive unnecessary notifications to ppl trying to do the right thing.|
Bespoke66|09/05/2020|Too many notifications|OK I downloaded the app because I thought it would help BUT I get sent a notification at least once a day. I don‚Äôt mind having the app running in the background like a set and forget app but I DO NOT WANT A NOTIFICATION EVERY SINGLE DAY. Just notify me if you need me to upload my info. I‚Äôm not a child I don‚Äôt need to be reminded that the app is on my phone and frankly I am so over all the advice and info on Coronavirus. I get it I am implementing all the social distancing and hygiene measures........ I just want to get on with life! STOP SENDING ME NOTIFICATIONS EVERY DAY. It is probably (at this time) the number 1 reason I will delete the app!|
Lagiace|26/04/2020|More info for users|Downloaded and registered without issue. Lots of people tried to register before the start time of 4pm AWST and ended up with error and frustration.|I would like to see a data count on the app to show how many people I have been closer than 1.5 metres and 15 minute duration.|This will give me indication that the app is working on my phone and I can verify the numbers I have in close proximity.|If the number is too high that expected then I may want to think how should I further distancing myself from others in public areas.|
LucBut|04/05/2020|It‚Äôs fine but maybe fewer notifications?|It‚Äôs fine and it‚Äôs great it‚Äôs available so quickly - that would have been a lot of effort :) But getting daily notifications that ‚Äòeverything is ok and remember to keep your Bluetooth on‚Äô is a bit much. I‚Äôm not going to fiddle with notifications in settings because having them on is the whole point right? But there‚Äôs a risk of notification fatigue/blindness if we get them every day then if we come into contact with someone we ignore the most important notification...|
Saxford|27/04/2020|Easy way to make everyone safer|Easy to install and sign up on iPhone. Does not seem to drain battery. I‚Äôd personally like to know if I‚Äôd been in contact with a positive case so I can protect my family and my workmates. Significant effort has been put into maximising privacy the government know they will be strung up if there is a breach. I imagine 99% of the apps on your phone have worse privacy vulnerability than this. Do your part and protect everyone around you! Australia is winning this fight and you can help!|
Adam_007|04/05/2020|Great easy to use but only one thing|Only one thing is that below the question ‚ÄúHas a health official asked you to upload your information?‚Äù there should be two buttons. Either a ‚ÄúYES‚Äù or ‚ÄúNO. If the user select ‚ÄúNO‚Äù the message which says ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nothing else you need to do except to leave the app running and keep Bluetooth on.‚Äù appears. If the user select ‚ÄúYES‚Äù then ‚ÄúUpload my information‚Äù button should appears. I hope they fix that soon. Thanks.|
North Sydneysider|29/04/2020|That‚Äôs a Fail!|Downloaded the app no problems. Today I received a notification so I opened the app to see what it was. The notification said I had tested positive for COVID-19 and asked me to tick a box to consent to the release of my data. Lol. I haven‚Äôt even been tested let alone tested positive. Nor do I know anyone who has been tested. I searched around for a phone number to report the problem but all I could find was the Coronavirus hotline number. I called this number to report the problem but they didn‚Äôt have an answer. All they could do was give me an email address for app support. So if I wanted to report this problem I would have to send an email thus giving them more of my data. I just deleted the app instead.|
VenixAU|29/04/2020|So far so good|I‚Äôm feeling a little bit safer for having this app as I travel on public transport to and from work - providing the people I‚Äôm travelling with have it too... Good job on the government getting this going it‚Äôs a great initiative if we‚Äôre wanting our lives to return to normal. For all those people concerned about the government knowing where you are it doesn‚Äôt track your location!! This is proven by the app not asking for access to location services.|I‚Äôm an IT professional and fully support it. Everyone should do their bit and get it.|
forgetfulFunctor|26/04/2020|The human toll of the COVIDSafe app|Sure this app may save lives. But what about the untold cost to privacy?|What will this mean for drug dealers already struggling to reorganise their supply chains after having been hit by the pandemic? It may surprise you to hear that many are not covered by the force majeure clauses that you and I take for granted.|And what about men who cheat on their wives.

Yes it may allow us to share more time with friends and family to free the aged from a terrible period of isolation. Yes it may help restore employment and self-fulfilment to the millions who have been rendered unemployed by the virus.|But I ask you is it really worth the cost?|
ANEECU1|26/04/2020|Please download!|Straightforward to download. For those concerned re privacy this app holds less information than Facebook or any other social media site you also can use a pseudonym. For all those users who have had trouble verifying phone number try downloading again and you need to omit the 0 at start of your number to enter it in international format. And you only need to have it open in background of your phone your iPhone does not need to be unlocked.|
cunneen|26/04/2020|So easy and may save lives.|I'm an app developer (I had nothing to do with this app though). We should ALL download & enable this. Privacy-wise they've taken the right approach. It'll still be useful even without a massive install base. If it notifies even one person who interacts with vulnerable people that they need to get tested it will have been worthwhile. It only asks for details that are already publicly available on the electoral roll plus your phone number. Worked perfectly for me.|
ArleneMC|27/04/2020|Doing what‚Äôs needed to control CoVid19|This app is safer than I originally thought. It‚Äôs crowdsourced information and not invading personal information.

gam999|06/05/2020|Work experience developers need more training|While I support the need for an app it seems the HCI designers need to get back to their year 9 classrooms rather than pretending to build serious apps. The whole idea of having a smart phone is to use it for a variety of applications in quick succession. smart phones are not supposed to be dedicated data loggers that can only do one thing. While I would like to run COVIDSafe when I go to the supermarket how can I then check my shopping list phone my partner to check the brand of cheese on the list respond to an sms etc etc. A massive fail by the devolopers or maybe the government procurement officers/ ministers who have accepted a dud and foisted it onto public.|

Pitabox987|10/05/2020|‚ÄúCrapvidSAFE‚Äù would be a more accurate name...|I dunno who the idiots were who wrote this app were are but they‚Äôre absolute morons!|The fact that this app doesn‚Äôt even work unless it‚Äôs always open in the foreground and doesn‚Äôt run in the background like basically the majority of all apps designed for iOS just goes to show just how stupid the government‚Äôs developers have become; not to mention it‚Äôs a serious breach in in user privacy and uses so much of a device‚Äôs resources that your device needs to be charged every few hours is a joke!|Well done to the government for making yourselves look like complete idiots deleted this app; I‚Äôll trust my common sense over this thing...|
Hassnick|14/05/2020|Apple/Google decentralised COVID tracking API|Embrace it! Understand the concerns about the lack of control especially for legality‚Äôs sake but right now the framework developed by Apple and Google is far more powerful and effective than the COVIDSAFE app. I can confirm with a simple Bluetooth listener that the app will not work on an iPhone 11 with the screen locked unless the app was opened and allowed to refresh its processes within the 60mins. This needs to be fixed.... iPhone users have a completely unusable app right now and if there are any claims counter this it simply isn‚Äôt true! We need the Aus Gov to embrace the new API and just get the app working properly.|
peteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee|27/04/2020|Let‚Äôs Do It Australia|No issues. Signed up and running. Easy. Great info on the registration screens. Just a name a phone number required. No GPS. Excellent. Much better than Facebook and google who ask you for your first born and track your every search keyword date of birth every travel-movement your friends your family .... etc. come on everyone - get on board. Such a simple low risk thing to keep us all safe. Stay safe everyone.|
MSKelleyMS|09/05/2020|Stop the dumb notifications|One person in my house has deleted the app because the notifications are annoying and stupid. Saying to keep it active is like having Karen explaining how to be ‚Äúon the line‚Äù on the interwebz.|Limit the notifications to maybe a reminder to have the app open in the background and Bluetooth on whenever you leave the house should surely be enough. Then maybe have a link/menu on the open screen to provide information to Karen about what it means to have the app ‚Äúactive‚Äù.|
BlueDynasty|28/04/2020|You‚Äôve successfully registered for COVIDSafe|And was told to... ‚ÄúPlease keep Bluetooth and Notifications enabled.‚Äù|No problems registering ensure Bluetooth and mobile data is active before the registration process. I used 0 preceding my number even though (+61) was indicated in the process.|I think once I‚Äôm home that there is no point keeping it running as I think this will use battery life however I usually turn Bluetooth off when at home to save power unless I‚Äôm forwarding picture to my spouse via AirPlay. Just have to remember to activate COVIDSafe each time I leave home so...|I‚Äôve set a reminder when a particular location has been determined such as ‚ÄúGetting in my car‚Äù when my Bluetooth connects to my car the alert will remind me to turn on COVIDSafe.|
AD1705|03/05/2020|Is it actually working?|I have no qualms with having this app more info is shared through the other apps I use daily and want to stop the spread. But is it actually working though? The daily notification tells you to make sure the app is running when out. Does that mean actually having your phone unlocked with the app going for it to work? That‚Äôs impossible and even if you do the other people around you don‚Äôt have it open so it‚Äôs not tracing anything? There needs to be clarification on this.|
mudbloodandproud|06/05/2020|Great|Just super annoying every morning I get a push notification from the app which is always the same thing. I would only want to be notified if I walked around and someone near me had contracted Coronavirus not just to open the app!|And you can‚Äôt turn push notifications off or it says it‚Äôs not ‚Äúactively tracking‚Äù me. Like what does that have to do with anything??|I‚Äôve downloaded it because I want to get home to my family. But dam if it isn‚Äôt annoying|
ZapNote|05/05/2020|I hope this app will be updated to use Apple‚Äôs upcoming API|This app is currently kind of pointless as it requires your phone to be unlocked and the app to be actively open on your screen for it to function effectively (a limitation of iOS not the developers). I very much hope with the upcoming release of iOS 13.5 that there are plans to upgrade this app to use the native exposure notification api that apple and google have developed. Most other countries around the world have already conceded that supporting this is the best way forward. I hope we follow and get rid of the background limitations this app would currently have. Are there any plans to do this?|
Onapele|28/04/2020|Turn off Wifi|Kept failing when trying to verify my mobile number after more than 10 attempts. Turned off Wifi on my phone so it uses my mobile telco directly and worked straight away.

pugmahorn|26/04/2020|Safest App You Will Have on your Phone|This app collects absolute minimal information about you. It doesn‚Äôt track where you‚Äôve been just who you‚Äôve been near.

Espritlibreone|06/05/2020|Simple and to the point missing crucial functionality|In kind of over the daily notifications to keep the app open. Which I appreciate is as a result of apple iOS design. However Apple has the same functionality in beta which this app should leverage the API for which would remove the requirement to keep the app open. Until then this app is actually kinda useless...|I would also like to see what data has been collected. That way I can validate if it's collecting the right info or right amount.|
leftHandMennace.|30/04/2020|Allow opt-in GPS|This may turnout to be pointless if you don‚Äôt allow for additional tracking. Many people would gladly give their location details if you let them. Appeasing the privacy lobbyists is fine but obviously if the modelling shows 40% of the population need the app to be effective then over 70% of smartphones users need the app 3 million is nowhere near enough. Allowing people to volunteer their information will make it more effective it wouldn‚Äôt be a difficult program change. Please let people help.|
sparky_rat|27/04/2020|Doesn‚Äôt Allow non-AU mobile numbers!|I am an AU citizen. Who normally lives overseas. Came here and got stuck (blessing now) when Corona broke out across the world. I want to do my part as I am living with family and 2 are essential workers. But my UK phone plan is better value than an Aussie one so I‚Äôm not interested in getting a Aussie one (and having to pay twice for phone sims) - i don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs necessary to have a AU number only. There will be so many people in Australia for any number of reasons who don‚Äôt have an AU number who will still want to download this and do the right thing.

thfzgbd|16/05/2020|Deleted to protest mandatory vaccination|Deleted the COVIDSafe app to protest against the mandatory flu vaccination of the NRL players.|While I believe that vaccines have their merits they are not as safe as made out by the mainstream media.|I vehemently oppose mandatory vaccination for multiple reasons. Most importantly mandatory vaccination leads to reduced responsibility for vaccine manufacturers. Also mandatory vaccination forces the individual to accept all the risks while removing the right to compensation except in cases of blatant culpability.|I am surprised that it isn‚Äôt mandatory to get a clean bill of health immediately prior to each vaccination. This way reactions would have to be attributed to either the vaccine or to an examination error. Either way an investigation would have to be carried out in every case of an adverse reaction.|
Go ones|14/05/2020|Glad to be part of the fight against COVID19|I downloaded this app when it was launched and have since then updated it to the latest version.

SayJayPop|28/04/2020|TURN OFF WIFI TO REGISTER!!|After trying and failing a million times with no luck to register turning off my wifi meant I could verify my mobile number without issue.|A glitch for sure but happy to have found a way to get past it.

Invictus1969|29/04/2020|Sadly....|I really want to do my part in helping the community recover/move past this horrid COVID situation but our furry friends in the federal government have half assed this app. Requiring it to be permanently open defeats the purpose of facilitating contact tracing (a critical element of from being safe to reduce the need for social distancing). By all accounts there was a better more functional and to be frank socio-literate app platform which was rejected for reasons only the government boffins know.|Making it harder to maintain useful functionality ain‚Äôt the smart move.|

Ajn85|29/04/2020|Works fine on iOS13|No issues to date with this app. Drop the leading 0 on your phone number if you‚Äôre having issues with setup. No noticeable difference on battery either.

Cluelessplayer|27/04/2020|If you have trouble getting PIN number.|Had trouble getting past entering my phone number and getting pin. Kept getting a message to say they couldn‚Äôt verify phone number! Yes I did delete the 0 from the beginning of the number. üòä|If you find you have problems too.... the trick is to turn off your wifi. It works using the mobile data!!|
Mike the fisho|26/04/2020|App won‚Äôt accept my correctly formatted number|Downloaded the app the minute it was released. For some reason the first 25 times I tried to enter my number it told me there was an error registering my number. There‚Äôs no links to an actual support line. Deleted the app reinstalled it then deleted it again and restarted my phone and tried again - NO JOY. Finally tried it again and it just worked?|If you‚Äôre having same trouble persevere and it should work eventually - looks like someone skipped the testing.|Terrible user experience and disheartening the government has managed to screw up something so important.|
darazz|27/04/2020|I‚Äôm Okay - Privacy|All seems good to me other apps and web sites know more about you anyway so many other apps out there that trace you! If this app reduces the current lockdown we are all in then it has to be for the better.|My concern is remembering to have the app running in the background and my battery life if it reduces my battery quickly unfortunately it‚Äôs gone.|
Neil Hargreaves|28/04/2020|Dutton‚Äôs dreams come true.|I have no faith in this current version of the conservative Australian government from bungled cruise ship entries to pork barreling sports rorts to dog whistling and politicising of asylum seekers.

In time I will delete the app and with luck the data won‚Äôt have been needed.|Now is not the time to be sceptical now is the time to think of the broader community and to act on behalf of public wellbeing.|Downloaded and use this app the health of all of us may depend upon it.|
Muddy2287|26/04/2020|Help Aus|Very easy to install and verify. But people who use the 0 of their mobile number will have problems because the programmer has put the +61 there and a lot of people do not understand what +61 means.|It may have been easy for all to install i an verify if everyone simply put their number in including the 0.|Always use the KISS principle.

zeafer|27/04/2020|Bluetooth limitations on iPhone|The app currently only works when you have it open and your iPhone unlocked.|Apple does not allow app developers to access Bluetooth from the background - so as soon as you open a different app or lock your phone this app doesn‚Äôt work. There is a change coming but not for another week or so. Hoping this app is updated to take advantage of the change ASAP!|
Searider1|26/04/2020|Does accept phone number|It would make sense to advise people that when they enter a phone number with +61 at the beginning you DO NOT enter the ‚Äú0‚Äù at the beginning of your phone number.|We may think that everybody should know this but there are many people who do not travel or make overseas phone calls so they may not be aware of international dialling protocols.|
BicDave|08/05/2020|Keeping my customers Safe|When I first heard about this app I was not sure wanting to join. However once expecting my beauty business to be open again I realize how much I need to keep my customers safe.

Ktbgreat2|28/04/2020|No problems from this Sceptical Optimist|I‚Äôve always been very wary of government taking too much power but I feel the current admin has been honest about what this apps capabilities are and I am confident it is no more infringing on my rights then any other day to day app. It‚Äôs voluntary and I can turn it off when I choose. Happy to see so many other people downloading it too|
gordino79|27/04/2020|Quick and easy|I‚Äôm usually a bit sceptical about using certain government apps. It says on the news it‚Äôs encrypted protects your details and you don‚Äôt have to give your real name.

Marahute|26/04/2020|This is Australia‚Äôs Dunkirk moment|Ok maybe a bit of hyperbole but seriously. On ANZAC day weekend the least you can do for your country is potentially give up a little privacy. We need 40% uptake for it to be effective. Let‚Äôs stop the tinfoil hats and just make this work.|Because of my profession I‚Äôm VERY familiar with information security the importance of data privacy and how data can be exploited. From what I can tell this app has been created with the highest standards and the best of intentions.|Before you criticise it for nefarious motives read the privacy policy and SEE what great lengths they have gone to make sure it is effective but minimally invasive.|And the UX is nice too which is a welcome change from previous government apps.|
Geoff_za|27/04/2020|Happy to download but only urgent notifications please!|Happy to provide less info than most common apps ask for but please... I don't want notifications unless there is a problem... I don't need to be reminded to keep my bluetooth on when it is in fact on...|A notification just popped up and my heart rate spiked!

Dagaroo|26/04/2020|All good|Just installed this from the App Store on an iPhone 8. Registered info verified phone number no problems at all.

Abused by Spam|26/04/2020|Incentives|What‚Äôs the chance of getting out for a beer or sitting on the beach if you could prove you had this app open on your phone?

There‚Äôs more info about you available every time you open your phone or appear on the TV saying you won‚Äôt use this!|
Maddy Noble|27/04/2020|Very Easy And Simple|Signed up very quickly. I‚Äôve seen reviews saying that the word CovidSafe keeps coming up on the screen. This happens when you tip your phone upside down so the screen faces down it is to safe power. So when signing up just try to keep your phone level or screen pointing upwards and it won‚Äôt happen. Hope this helps.|
&&&$$$???|18/05/2020|Should be compulsory|They need to advertise how it works on TV more. Unfortunately there are still many people out there who think it‚Äôs tracks them and they don‚Äôt want the ‚Äògovernment‚Äô to have their personal details. They need a 1 minute commercial on tv that explains what it does and doesn‚Äôt do. Ignorance is letting us down.... come on Australia download and use it!!!|
tomchard|05/05/2020|Surprisingly good app|As always you‚Äôd expect the Aus Government to measure once and cut twice but in this instance they haven‚Äôt.|The app is very good and very easy to register on.

RebeccaPerth|02/05/2020|The spinny wheel thing|How come the wheel up the top of my iPhone screen is spinning for a while sometimes since downloading the app? Is it because of background data being turned on? Also is there any way to have this app running and still have my low power mode setting on? I like saving battery power. Cheers|
Suzem13|27/04/2020|Finally managed to get Pin|I gave this a one star after being unable to get past the ‚Äúerror verifying phone number‚Äù message and I was unable to get a pin after several attempts. Then I switched off my WiFi and just used 4G and it worked straight away! Maybe they need to include that in the instructions.|
Lizeymon|04/05/2020|Does the job - no issues|The app is working well without any battery drain issues. Note that an individual has control over whether the app is running and gov‚Äôt needs permission to access your phone data so that should alleviate any concerns re privacy. I think everyone should use this app so we can get back to normal-ish life.|
Karlos 007|28/04/2020|Fine to use|Your mind should be at ease because you share info when you decide with a button with just the Aussie government health dept. Compared to ‚Äòfree game or social apps‚Äô that constantly sync data in the background and don‚Äôt clearly tell you what they are collecting about you and only ever generally tell you who they shared with. The infamous ‚Äòthird parties‚Äô phrase.|
Nisha...|26/04/2020|Simple and straightforward|The news said it would be active at 6 pm however it worked for me at 5:48 pm and the final screen states that the app is active and I am registered.|The security measures in place to protect the privacy of users are very comforting and I have no issues in letting the app use my Bluetooth (which is always on anyway) to assist in tracking and controlling the spread of Covid-19|
The original Cary.|12/05/2020|Does not track you.|For those saying this is another way the government can track you. Seriously grow up. You install it and it does not ask you anything about using location.|If you are concerned about your data delete it.|If you still think that this can be used to track you.

yoshi7af|06/05/2020|Apps fine but why?|What's the point in me having this if the people that are out and about spreading Mrs. Rona either don't care enough or don't trust the government enough (with good reason) to even download it.|I've been using it though during exercise and drives to the store just in case I get pulled up on it as i'm not sure how any of these new lockdown laws work (as do all the police that have pulled me over during this weird time).|I've yet to walk past someone with Rona.|
VoxP|27/04/2020|Error verifying phone number|App will have an error during registration process when you submit your mobile phone and you used an alias name with a number in it.

Bradley.Williams|05/05/2020|I trust our information is safe|The app installed perfectly on my phone no bugs or glitches as of yet solid app. I trust our information is safe in the governments hands.|Great idea I would have implemented this app in the same way if I were in charge. 15mins of you being in the area of a COVID-19 patient and you will be alerted outstanding work.|
Madwife4|01/05/2020|iPhone user|If indeed the contact tracing works best (or maybe only) when the app is open on the screen and the screen unlocked (and my phone did not automatically lock after the set time when this was the case and I wasn‚Äôt holding it) then the battery will drain very quickly and it‚Äôs also a major security risk if we lose sight of our phones for a moment or more.|Running as a background app would make much more sense.|Also conflicting information has been given re running the app in power saver mode or not.|
WizardOfAuz|26/04/2020|Easy set up - verification available after 6pm|All the reviews saying they couldn‚Äôt verify their number didn‚Äôt read or listen to the launch of the app stating that they can fully register their mobile number after 6pm AEST.

SimonCraig|26/04/2020|Downloaded and registered in seconds|Downloaded and registered on this easily in seconds. App works in the background and will only ‚Äòdo something‚Äô if you happen to spend more that 15mins with someone who later tests positive to Covid-18. Otherwise sits quietly in the background.

nitramluap|09/05/2020|Reasonable - bud need the proper API|Due to the iPhone‚Äôs *very reasonable* privacy & battery limitations on developers this needs to use the upcoming Apple Exposure Notification API - and there is no excuse for it to not be ready the second iOS 13.5 drops as it‚Äôs been available to Developers for several weeks already.|If they do NOT use the Apple API I shall be uninstalling this as it is totally pointless to require it to run in the foreground at all times.

Help! I‚Äôve deleted and reinstalled the app and rebooted it a number of times too.|
midlap|27/04/2020|Great app|It has a rough launch but has a easy set up and is simple to use. While on the topic it‚Äôs pretty entertaining to read the conspiracy theories in the other reviews. One guy was upset that it would send you a message if you came in contact with an infected person claiming it an evil invasion of their privacy. Little by little I‚Äôm losing faith in people.|
digitalboss|26/04/2020|App User|Improvement suggestion. Set an anonymous home location and use location services to send you a notification to turn the app on when you leave your home location. This would allow you to have the app running only when you leave your anonymous home location. You only need the app running when you leave home.|
ajhancox|26/04/2020|Big fan of this initiative|Message for App developers. When searching iOS store I typed Covid Safe as 2 words. Search results were none. (Tried again typing Covidsafe as 1 word & found the App). Suggest the word search in iOS store is corrected with either 1 or 2 word search should lead me to the App. We don‚Äôt to lose people at the download stage.|
StuartCRyan|26/04/2020|Limited information gathered|Great to see the limited information gathered no more than could be found out online about most already. Also great that the only information that is technically required for validation is your mobile number.|These are strange times and this is a necessary short term solution!|
BNEtaxiuser|14/05/2020|Good but needs to be always on in background|The app is an absolutely great idea and hope everyone downloads it. The only issue I have is you have to turn it on why cannot it not always be on even if the app is closed if google can always track me (by choice) why can this app not just work and make it safer for all as no forgetting to turn it on.|
prdaniels|02/05/2020|Possible glitch|Great initiative but a possible glitch: when I‚Äôm streaming music over bluetooth to my wireless headphones I wonder if this app makes the music cut off periodically - it appears to disconnect the headphones entirely. As I‚Äôm quite a heavy user of these headphones unfortunately I can‚Äôt use the app at the same time. This issue with the music/headphones cutting out periodically (every 20mins or so? Sometimes more frequently) seemed to only begin when I‚Äôd installed the app.|
mike_ay|26/04/2020|Thank you!|To the people having a good moan look at what the Parliament (both main parties) have done to keep us safe. Yes this is an app that may need some tweaks but to roll this out across the country I‚Äôm addition to everything else that is being done to keep us with one of the lowest rates in the world well just have a little patience|
CardSmart|26/04/2020|Help yourself and help others|This app is about being able to be contacted if you‚Äôve come in contact with a COVID19 identified person. It‚Äôs clean crisp and simple. And single purpose.|Would have been nicer if it gave a little vibrate when your app did a handshake with another phone to prove its working - but maybe the next version.|
‚Ä¢_‚Ä¢ ;)|27/04/2020|I‚Äôm confident!|iPhone 11 Max Pro super easy required far less information than other apps. Didn‚Äôt even ask for e-mail address.|I work in construction and believe that this app gives me the best chance to keep those at home I love safe by alerting me of any risk that I should be concerned about that I would otherwise be unaware of.|
daHarves|10/05/2020|15 minute contact is too long|We‚Äôre hearing that this app hasn‚Äôt collected data yet. Until health authorities / the CMO acknowledges that COVID-19 can be spread with contact a LOT less than 15 minutes and remember that this is not the flu...|This app needs a custom sensitivity setting. To allow me to set my own time between 1 and 15 minutes.|The app is ineffective otherwise.|Privacy concerns are also moot while the app isn‚Äôt sensitive enough and collect enough data.|
HiPPityHoPPditty|09/05/2020|Concerning...|When I clicK ‚ÄúUpload My Details‚Äù on the main Page of this aPP a screen of text comes uP saying ‚ÄúYou have tested Positive to COVID-19‚Äù. It then asKs if I consent to uPloading my info. I WOULD consent to this but I KNOW I have not tested Positive for COVID-19. I don‚Äôt Know if this is an error with the program or just bad wording but I am now concerned that if I do my civic duty and uPload my Personal details to the aPP that I will be incorrectly recorded as a Possibly contagious carrier of the virus.|Honestly I‚Äôm now a little concerned about rePorting this issue...|
billy.everyteen|05/05/2020|Runs fine in background and not a battery hog|Have seen no change in my phones battery utilisation and the app just runs fine in the background with no interaction needed. Have had no issues setting it up and get the occasional notification that the app is working.|
Mat 123441136|04/05/2020|Runs fine|Low battery drain.|Would be great to show details so I know it‚Äôs working and more importantly show others the info it collects on screen much easier to explain that it‚Äôs a good thing.|The log of my tempids so I can see they change.|The log of contacts to see what info is being broadcast and stored.|
Akae7|28/04/2020|Small thing we do to save lives|Its just some simple steps thats not taking more than 1 min to register. And phone number definitely necessary for us to get contacted if we need to be. I really felt we should sacrifice a little of our privacy to let us get back to our normal life faster.|
YoungNational|26/04/2020|Verifying was simple and easy|I hope everyone takes the right approach and downloads this app so we can reopen our communities sooner and deal with any cases efficiently should more occur.|Contrary to boomer belief this app does not track your location or use GPS. Do not believe the fear mongers who say otherwise.|Every precaution has been taken|
nata323232|30/04/2020|Good app but issues with iPod connection|Overall works fine but keeps disrupting my AirPods when listening to music which is annoying because when I‚Äôm out it‚Äôs the only time when I use them and at the same time it is critical that the app keeps connected. Please look into it as others are also experiencing the same issue.|
Anthony Lewis 8765234|29/04/2020|Remembering to activate is a hassle|I really want this to work well. I really do. But there are 2 main issues.|1. Remembering to activate it when you go out.|2. You then can‚Äôt use your phone to answer calls reply to messages use Wallet to pay for things etc.|I realise that having an app with BLE running in the background is not allowed with Apple but this really needs to be escalated quickly to ensure this app can be used effectively.|
Kastronoth|28/04/2020|No problems signing up|To have no problems signing up you need to drop the leading zero to your phone number and also turn off wifi and use mobile data. For some reason this has worked on 3 phones for me with no problems.|
TuckMasterFOS|27/04/2020|If you have the mobile number issue / error|If you having the issue that it can not verify your mobile number error.|Make sure that you have wifi off! In other words be on 4G / mobile data.|Hope that helps and stay safe|
Geoffsthoughts|26/04/2020|Perfect|Set up is quick and easy all up and running in under 5 minutes.|All the reviews with complaints about not being able to register their phone number are most likely putting in a 0 at the start. Note the 61 it‚Äôs then your number without the leading zero.|
liongalahad82|05/05/2020|Great and privacy is totally safe|App is great and stores all data in the phone data is shared only if you get tested positive and you agree to share it. It was 3rd party reviews and they found it totally safe from a privacy point of view. Whoever doesn't download it because of privacy concerns is either misinformed or a fool.|
2015JED|05/05/2020|Bug detected??|While trying to register myself I get an error msg which says - Error verifying phone number. Advice please.|Also in the Apple App Store there is no contact email or phone number for app support - not good Scomo - so I had to resort to rating the app to communicate with the developer - sigh!|‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî|5 May 20 Now running perfectly.|Even like the gentle reminder each day if the app or Bluetooth are off.|Well done developers - you might even become legends if the Govt mandates this app as part of AUS lockdown restrictions easing - personally I think it should be mandated in pubs - clubs - cinemas - restaurants etc so I become aware of any CV19 infected ppl near me üëçü§òüëç|
Scooter Bigglesworth|27/04/2020|Possible solution for phone number problem|Tried numerous times to register mobile number. Failure after failure while connected to wi fi. Tried disconnecting wifi to use 4G and verification number was sent instantly.|Fully endorse the purpose of the app. The herd needs to work together|
heath1955|27/04/2020|Appears to be a problem installing on wifi|I couldn‚Äôt get the thing to accept my phone number (yes it was in right format). Scrolling thru comments and saw a comment about wifi. Turned off wifi and voila! It worked. This looks to be a bug that needs fixing. Or give people a hint on the app would avoid a lot of frustration. Otherwise great initiative.|
RobyK|27/04/2020|Thank you Australia|Every little bit helps.|Easy to download.|Set and forget until the time comes that you get diagnosed or called to say you have been in contact with someone who has been diagnosed. Then the magic of contact tracing becomes so much easier. Who knows this could save someone elses life.|
wellyoucanguess|26/04/2020|Well done. Good initiative|Well done team aus gov. Special üëèüèª to the brains behind this app and tech. Definitely can be improved from|Bt technology to other means but so far excellent initiative. Would recommend everyone to start using this app. I think this is a sacrifice we need to make to keep everyone safe including each you..|
Eee.N|26/04/2020|HOW TO FIX MOBILE NUMBER ISSUE!|My parter and I had no issue with registering. When you get to the mobile number bit +61 is already there so when putting your mobile number in don‚Äôt do 04 just do 4 and the rest of your number. +61 replaces the 0 in the 04 beginning of a mobile number. Hope that makes sense and helps.|
Bprandall|26/04/2020|Great safe step forward|Kudos to govt for doing so much more than most others. This app seems safe and I care about my privacy. They only get my basic contact info if I or someone who was near me for 15+ mins get CoVID and they both seem reasonable reasons to let them contact me or those I was close to. Overall I am happy!|
Lulu-1961|03/05/2020|15 minutes of proximity required? False sense of security|Is 15 minutes of proximity really required to transfer the virus?|If you had close contact with someone eg shook hands coughed spoke without a mask used a shopping trolley without wiping it down etc couldn't you catch/spread the virus? But that contact wouldn't register on the app because it only took a few seconds.|Keep a diary: Every evening record where you've been and who you've been in contact with during the day.|
OzTurtle|28/04/2020|Turn off Bluetooth wifi to register?|If you‚Äôre having trouble registering try turning off Bluetooth and wifi. It worked for me - Before I did this the process was failing at the point where it issues a PIN. Turned off wifi and Bluetooth and registration worked. Turned everything back on afterwards and it seems fine.|
Sammii715|26/04/2020|Straight Forward|I downloaded the app and everything worked out fine simple easy verifying with six digit number sent to your phone.|You can delete anytime regardless it‚Äôs not compulsory so people need to chill out.|Can‚Äôt wait to go to the pub and back to the football in the hopefully near future!|
Hifive496|26/04/2020|Quick and easy|App was very quick and straight forward to setup and register. Those who had trouble with this may have been entering their mobile number beginning with zero? The zero needs to be left off. Looking forward to seeing how effective this technology is.|
N1Mike|26/04/2020|Loaded No Problem|I loaded this app in a few minutes. I read the previous review who couldn‚Äôt get past the phone number page. As the number is entered in international format you just need to drop the ‚Äú0‚Äù at the beginning of your number. I hope this can keep the nation safe|
mattcameron10|26/04/2020|Fantastic initiative easy to register|Great to see an easy to use and highly relevant app launched by the govt. in a timely manner. For those with privacy concerns: you can choose to download or not but if not then one would hope you stay isolated and keep others safe. Australia has a good record in regard to respecting its citizens privacy.|
jesseebr|26/04/2020|If this helps easy restrictions +++|To anyone suspicious of a ‚Äútracking‚Äù app - this doesn‚Äôt even use gps. Seriously your already on a smart phone with social media and google that are ACTUALLY tracking every tiny detail in your life. Move along and help everyone else stay healthy and get some normal life back|
Phil Scott|18/05/2020|Design flawed|The idea is great but execution is poor.|The power use is crazy and it slows down all other apps in use. As taxi driver I need my phone active and power not getting drained like I live streaming. I can‚Äôt even use my google maps while this is running as they lag way to much to be any use which only happens while this app running.|Maybe it‚Äôs because I on older iPhone but I don‚Äôt get why such basic app is a bigger power hog than running live stream vids.|
Kit Mann|28/04/2020|Trouble with mobile number|Easy to set up except for it not accepting mobile number. I left the 0 off the beginning of number as suggested below in a review but still didn‚Äôt work. I noted I was on wifi so I then changed to using mobile data along with leaving 0 off number. This worked. All the best everyone and take care.|
Kirstenaaa|27/04/2020|Still can‚Äôt verify phone number : (|I have not been able to verify my phone number through this app yet to get it working. I‚Äôve deleted & re-installed dropped the 0 tried many times. Anyone have any ideas??|I‚Äôve left 4 stars as I don‚Äôt want to de-value the app but it is a bit frustrating as I don‚Äôt know who to contact about this. Thanks|
Gaz in WA|27/04/2020|Doesn‚Äôt work on my IPhone 7. I can‚Äôt get past the stage when I enter my phone number.|Turned off wifi. Closed all other apps and did a hard reset on the phone. Restarted phone and clicked on the COVIDSafe App. Registration only took a few seconds and it appears to be working fine now. üëç|
dsut1000|27/04/2020|Phone number verification error fix|If you see this error check to make sure you‚Äôre not on a wifi connection. You need to be on a mobile data connection to complete the verification process. Just thought I‚Äôd share what I worked out as a fix after seeing the same error as many others.|
Mike BP|26/04/2020|App DOES work with correct mobile number|A lot of negative reviews about the mobile number not working but it needs to be entered WITHOUT the 0 in front of the 4. The mobile you enter needs to be 9 digits long not 10. A suggestion for the developers is to remove the leading 0 if people enter it by mistake.|
pete123123|26/04/2020|Working Now|In the interest of getting people to use the app I am reviewing to say it worked for me. I saw lots of people saying it didn‚Äôt work - it worked for me so perhaps they‚Äôve fixed it. Give it a go I was able to put my number in and register without a problem. Left the 0 out.|
Mesipisian|04/05/2020|Choice as!|Works well does what it says on the label. I have my phones gps turned off and COVIDSafe still works so it does not care about your location and does no even ask for access. Easy to setup. Negligible battery usage does not even show in my top 10 battery users. A+++|
DJJoshuaGames|03/05/2020|Lets stop the spread|Download this app to protect your fellow Aussies. It‚Äôs easy to register and you don‚Äôt need an email account to register. Just a few clicks to stay safe from coronavirus. It‚Äôs also pretty dang useful if you are near someone who is diagnosed with COVID19 because you get notified. I Recommend downloading to stay safe. üòÑ|
zottles|01/05/2020|Some issues|The only notifications the app sends me seem to imply that I‚Äôve turned it off. But it‚Äôs always on except in one situation. When I‚Äôm with a client trying to take a payment using the Square payment app I have to close COVIDSafe because it causes the Bluetooth card reader to lose contact. And that‚Äôs about the only situation when I‚Äôm anywhere near anyone outside my family so it loses its usefulness.|
megzyjeffs|28/04/2020|Can‚Äôt get a pin|Two of us in our household are unable to get a pin. We have tried reinstalling app and have tried again early this morning. Want to do the right thing but can‚Äôt make it work. Can‚Äôt verify number is what the message eventually says. One is Samsung one is iPhone.|
LeanneCrystalTiger|28/04/2020|Can‚Äôt get PIN|I dint know why I can‚Äôt get pin they ask for it just keeps spinning and eventually sometimes comes up as error we can verify your number and I have tried both with and without the first 0 being put in. I even turned my mobile off and in again still didn‚Äôt help I think I noticed one other person having this problem on here are there any others? I really believe in the app but it‚Äôs not allowing me access üò™|
Tonners4184|27/04/2020|Would be great if it worked!|Have now tried to enter my mobile number at least 20 times both with the 0 at the front and without and it keeps giving an error message! I would hope that this gets fixed quickly because I‚Äôm a willing participant and I‚Äôm getting frustrated if anyone was a reluctant participant and this error happened continuously I think they would lose a lot of people and those people would just say oh well I tried and it didn‚Äôt work! Sort it out!|
MofoJonathanJo|27/04/2020|Please download|This app is all about saving lives so please install on your iPhone. I did so immediately when it went live and it works fantastically. Your privacy will be safe but please think of everyones health and safety first as a priority. Think of your family your friends and what you can do to help.|
dwayneo91|26/04/2020|Fingers crossed|Like everyone else it didn‚Äôt verify my phone number so my initial review was the first disappointed one. But they‚Äôve since fixed the issue and it‚Äôs up and running.|I can‚Äôt give it five stars because the jury is still out on it working or not. But it‚Äôs easy to sign up for (now) and fingers crossed that it helps Australia continue to hold the virus at bay.|
cas_niko|26/04/2020|App up and running|The app is up and running. Super easy to register through your mobile number and doesn‚Äôt ask for much information.|Seems like everyone who downloaded the app early didn‚Äôt listen to the government who said you could register from 6pm.|
Wechikoma|26/04/2020|Mobile verification worked fine with me|Mobile verification seems to be working for me. When prompted for the number I left out the ‚Äò0‚Äô at the beginning of my number.|Though I did experience the ‚ÄòCOVID-19‚Äô splash screen keep popping up and going away during my registration process. Seems to be only at the registration process so it was all good afterwards.|
Scheherazade88|16/05/2020|It is good but I‚Äôm wondering if it could be better|First of all if this app helps us track and trace I‚Äôm for it. One way it could possibly be improved is if there was a way of including a daily count of how many handshakes had happened. I think It would be useful for people to know how often it has occurred so they can moderate their behaviour.|
Australasia My Thoughts|27/04/2020|Turn WiFi off to register!!!! Wish that was instructions!!!!|I want to install this app for all that it supports. However the app won‚Äôt accept my phone number and says I need to check my details ... I‚Äôve entered both with the 0 and without multiple times ... i have now also deleted the app and retried multiple times. I hope they are basing their registration count on successfully registered numbers and not app downloads!! Imagine how many registrations there would be if this was smooth sailing!|
Aubz11|26/04/2020|Downloaded & Registered|Downloaded the app & registered with no issues. People complaining about not being able to pass the phone number section no issues here. Removed the 0 from my mobile number and away we go.|
Chatters23|26/04/2020|Simple and safe. Thanks Scotty|Scomo.... You‚Äôre a true leader that‚Äôs leading the way over the world. Privacy is not an issue. All details are stored in the phone. Easy to setup and operate! Can‚Äôt wait to get back out into the real world. Just have to hope Dopey Dan the Communist also gets behind it his arrogance leaves him wanting to run his own ship.|
BrissieRuth|15/05/2020|Now not working on my iPhone 5|I have today uploaded the latest COVID19 Safe App on my iPhone 5 - it was working fine before this update - but now the screen won't stay open as the front screen and doesn't appear to me to be operating.|I could not find any where else to record request for technical support for this app|
Denzil TwoFathers|13/05/2020|App + Bluetooth are energy hogs.|I downloaded the app the day it came out and I support it 100% but I‚Äôm finding that keeping the app running and requiring Bluetooth is draining my battery to the point where I‚Äôm only getting half a day‚Äôs use (iPhone X). I only leave the house for work but when I‚Äôm at work I have to turn off the app and Bluetooth or I drain my battery defeating the purpose of having the app.|
ksquigs|30/04/2020|Not hard to do your bit!|This is a great app. The more people download it the sooner we‚Äôll be back to normal.|My only issue is that it‚Äôs only available in the Australian App Store. I have friends who are expats living in Australia who want to download the app but are unable to because they still use the global/another country‚Äôs App Store. This is much like the people in Australia without Australian mobile numbers. If both of these things could be fixed that‚Äôd be helpful.|I wonder if the developers could maybe just geofence Australia and then open the app for everyone to use?|Just a thought.|
User4574|28/04/2020|Killer of my phone battery. üò±ü¶†üîã|This is a great idea and I really want to use it I don‚Äôt care about all the tinfoil hat wearing people who want to complain about privacy I care only about battery life of my phone this app Is like a virus for your iPhone due to a bad battery I have the obsessive compulsive need to close all apps before putting the phone back in my pocket! ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è|

Fhgcvg|27/04/2020|Download if you want to get back to the pub|As I was trying to fill in details the screen would fade to black and say COVIDSafe in the centre randomly and frequently made it really difficult to fill it out. Might be enough to stop a lot of people from completing so maybe fix that up soon|
MrNAdds|26/04/2020|People can‚Äôt read|The app works fine and registration was easy.|Instructions on the official websites stated that the registration would be available after 6pm. Everyone who had issues with phone number verification were trying to register prior to that time.|
azza5442|26/04/2020|Simple to set up|I downloaded the app and was able to set it up within 2 minutes I see a lot of reviews saying that the app can‚Äôt verify there phone numbers I‚Äôm guessing that is due to to many people trying to do it at the same time and causing an overload to the servers|
Bella Boris|26/04/2020|Drop the first # 0 in your mobile number|I initially read the reviews first before downloading and everyone was having trouble with the phone number.. drop the first #0 from your number and it works just fine.. very easy to set up..|stay safe everyone|
Booked line & sinker|26/04/2020|COVIDSafe - Entering phone number|Several people have said app not verifying phone number. Asking for +61 number.

Tank(AO)|26/04/2020|Give it a go. It might help.|I had to input my phone number a few times for it to work. I‚Äôm usually paranoid however no issues with privacy on this one. Heck you give more information to google and facechook. At least this might get us back to a realistic normality sooner.|
Stacebarinacd|08/05/2020|Would not allow me to sign up|I tried multiple times on different days including reinstalling the app over 3 times.|I read a review to turn of wifi and this worked for me. Unfortunately it would not work with my surname with the ‚Äò in it.|Love the idea but needs to be easier to sign up because not everyone will keep trying when it doesn‚Äôt work.|
Weetah 201J|05/05/2020|WHY 15 MINUTES?|I‚Äôm puzzled that authorities believe it takes 15 minutes to catch COVID-19 off an infected person. Shouldn‚Äôt this app be registering contacts of shorter duration for it to be effective? I certainly won‚Äôt allow myself to remain within 1.5 metres of another for a lengthy 15 minutes but could have the misfortune of someone passing me in the grocery aisle as they sneezed.|
shadykins-au|27/04/2020|To the team ...|I‚Äôd like to thank the PO BA designer content writer developer tester QA architect etc who know doubt worked some long nights to get this approved and out the door in such a small timeframe. I‚Äôm sure navigating it through risk compliance and legal while still making it understandable was fun. From one who know what‚Äôs involved - I thank you!|
Amoz&Temba|16/05/2020|App stopped working today|App will not send the pin to my mobile number cannot reactivate the app on my iPhone that up until now has not had any problems.|Trying to do the right thing however when the app server appears to be faulting it is getting more and more difficult to maintain the app use that is constantly draining my phone battery.|Please URGENTLY resolve the app issue!!|Note - not a user error I have wifi off have not had issues up until today with using the app.|
NIH156|29/04/2020|Thanks to this great initiative.|Great to see the app has attracted over 2m downloads within 3 days since the launch. Given it has passed the Privacy Impact Assessment and received full endorsement from OAIC I‚Äôm encouraging everyone to do our bits in securing the wellbeing of our people and communities by installing this app. #We‚ÄôreAllInThis2gether|
Boogaslot|29/04/2020|It‚Äôs fine but...|Can you please stop the annoying ‚ÄòWe need you..‚Äô message that comes up every second day.|I get it - the app is working in the background as requested and I take my phone everywhere. I just don‚Äôt need the reminder telling me to do what I‚Äôm already doing.|
TeejayRyan|27/04/2020|No details needed - it‚Äôs perfect|You just put your name (don‚Äôt even have to use real name) and your age range (20‚Äôs 40‚Äôs etc). It doesn‚Äôt ‚Äútrack you‚Äù it just keeps track of all the people you go near then if someone has it you find out right away not weeks later. Perfect!|
mckeaj|26/04/2020|Note: Caanot use zero at start of mobile number|Good to see app is live. When entering mobile please do not include first zero or you get an error. App weiters- please just handle this! Hopefully this helps us get on top of this bug until we have some better medical controls in place|
ausJCP|26/04/2020|Works perfectly fine|Ignore the 1 star reviews from people who don‚Äôt know how to read. The govt released the app today at 3pm and go-live for registration was at 6pm. Reviewers saying the app is broken simply didn‚Äôt wait for the correct launch time as notified via the media. Pretty sad indictment of our society!|
Annehhhzhshdhhshs|26/04/2020|Unable to sign up!|Can‚Äôt sign up as it gives me an error message about my phone number ‚Äòerror verifying phone number please check your details and try again‚Äô. Checked my mobile number several times it‚Äôs definitely correct.|

knpviap|02/05/2020|Option to view stats?|I think it‚Äôd be very handy if there was an option to view or check stats on ‚Äúcontact‚Äù data collected by the app. This would allow users to check for themselves if the app was actually working and/or how well it works with their iPhone locked in their pocket.|
Winner743|30/04/2020|App restarted after 3 days|I downloaded and set up the app about 3 days ago and it was running fine but this morning it made me set it up again. If this happens every few days it will get annoying and also is a risk that the app can‚Äôt fulfill its function properly if users have to re-enter their details every few days. Hopefully it was just a one off!|
Ros√© Dinks|29/04/2020|Download the app|If you want to get out of lockdown quicker and get back to normal life quicker just download the app. You are helping not only yourself but other people. If you are worried about being ‚Äútracked‚Äù you are likely being tracked already from the social media apps you use|
Syd Harbour|27/04/2020|Well done and thank you|A lot fail to understand that the likes of twitter and Facebook already take so much data and sell it or use it to target you. This app saves lives and Data is only released if you authorise it. Easy to use no fine print. Well done.|
brett said|27/04/2020|Would a watch app be better?|It‚Äôs a good initiative and the app is well considered and designed taking into account the turn around time required.|Not an expert would a watch app be better considering the limitations of Bluetooth on a phone? Locked screen background processing etc.|
Monchi71|27/04/2020|Availability for visa holders|Make the app available for all country iTunes accounts because any person visiting or a visa holder probably has their home country iTunes and if you don‚Äôt make it available to them it will limit the info. 1.6million temp visa holders are currently in Australia so it‚Äôs worth doing|
Sharu143|27/04/2020|Easy to access|I find it easy to access. Definitely recommend it to others. Good friend of mine sent it to me and I shared it with my family and friends. Hopefully soon this will over and we‚Äôll be back to our everyday lifeüòä Thanks for creating this appüòá|
Sophsta&!|26/04/2020|Worked first time|Had no trouble verifying my number. Also added my work mobile and all went smoothly. Well designed app good amount of information without being bureaucratic. Simple but effective way to help lift restrictions and keep us all safe.|
jason8642|26/04/2020|You‚Äôre mad if you don‚Äôt download this app|You don‚Äôt have to use your name just enter your mobile number and you‚Äôll be notified if you‚Äôve come into close contact with a COVID19 case and if you happen to catch it they can use this info to let others know.|
WOPA008|27/04/2020|USELESS|Needs access to functions that I don‚Äôt use. Pointless for me as the app would never work.|Better option have an app that tells people that face masks won‚Äôt stop you getting COVID and if you‚Äôre wearing a face mask then obviously you should‚Äôve be out and about as you‚Äôre a risk to everyone else because you have COVID.|Of better still an app that tells you which local supermarkets have the types/brands of pasta rice flour hand soap toilet paper and tissues in stock do you can actually get what you need.|
TheTikiTikiTiki|26/04/2020|Easy Setup|Setup without a problem. Time will tell whether it keeps running on an iPhone without frequent intervention. Also with regard to some low ratings I suspect servers might be overloaded for the SMS verification and that‚Äôs why some people are having an issue. Just wait a day or two.|
Boucephales|26/04/2020|Easy to register|I found the app easy to register and read the privacy statement easily. I am curious to know how my battery use will be impacted by having Bluetooth on all the time but we‚Äôll see. I have a feeling all it will record is continual contacts with my husband.|Good luck everyone and we‚Äôll done app developers and designers.|
Agghtcbjuvj|07/05/2020|Just download the app|Just download the app so we can go out to a cafe or a restaurant. The people not downloading are just selfish and only thinking about themselves. They are also on Facebook etc guess what you are traced more on google and Facebook than this app. So just download the app...|
mtnsgirl|07/05/2020|Push notification|Constant push notifications ‚ÄòWe need you to help stop the spread of Covid-19...‚Äô asking me to enable my Bluetooth while it is already enabled and the app is installed successfully and working are driving me nuts.|Should be able to turn off the push notifications unless it‚Äôs an urgent one such as notification of Covid-19 exposure or at the very least let me select how frequently I want to receive push notifications.|
Chibibible|01/05/2020|A glitch or app feature?|I just downloaded it and everything but I found that anytime my phone is close to me the screen for the app blacks out and just has ‚ÄúCOVIDSafe‚Äù in the middle. I moved the screen away and then it went back to normal it‚Äôs like every time it‚Äôs facing me it‚Äôs ‚ÄúCOVIDSafe‚Äù but then I tilt it slightly and it has the app working. Don‚Äôt know if this just glitch or feature of the app.|
Jatz crackers 26|28/04/2020|Took a bit of effort but got there in the end|Took me the best part of 24 hours to get the PIN number to verify my phone but got there in the end. My guess is was just due to the volume of people down loading and trying to sign up.|Hopefully we get enough people doing it and we can get back to normal sooner|
i love builder buddies|28/04/2020|Parents talk to your kids|It‚Äôs our 20-29 yo most likely to contract/carry covid 19! Yet this age group seems more opposed to being tracked. I suggest all parents really sit down and discuss what it means for the community and their family and encourage them to download - hey if it means we lift restrictions quicker better for all!|
ITDirectorUkOx|27/04/2020|Protecting Each Other ü§ù|As an Australian Permanent Resident but UK national I am extremely fortunate to be in this beautiful country during such a globally challenging time for all peoples. This app is testament to the Australian government exercising its primary duty to protect its people.|The more of us that download the quicker we can all get back normal and back to work.|
Z1mb0|27/04/2020|Found the problem|For those getting an error "Error verifying number" try turning off your wifi and use mobile data instead that solved it in my case and of course no leading zero on your number.|
Lena D'Spiare|26/04/2020|A great app!|Easy to use and a quick process. People seem to forget that you cannot register before 6pm. Shame for the negative reviews. I hope it doesn‚Äôt push people away given people were too eager and tried to register before 6pm. Please download this app!|
AdeyGiles|26/04/2020|Installs easily and makes sense.|Everyone should download this to keep our friends and family safe. There is a lot of other apps on my phone that collect a lot more data than this does so anyone who thinks this is a privacy invasion needs their head examined. #iamcovidsafe|
Hugefart|14/05/2020|I‚Äôm not going to forget a global pandemic.|The idea and everything behind the app is great.|Getting notifications every day is annoying and I have turned off the notifications for the app.|Only sending notifications if it‚Äôs important would be a great upgrade.|There is a global pandemic I‚Äôm not going to wake up and forget that so please stop with the notifications.|
lockedsquirrel|13/05/2020|iPhone capability limited|On iPhones does the app actually work in the background or when my screen is locked? I often have to log in multiple times which makes me think it doesn‚Äôt or at least not consistently. That seems counterproductive and not shielding me or those around me. It needs a fix pronto. Otherwise super easy to use.|
tophersome|08/05/2020|Running counter|Would be great if there was a counter to see how many people you have come into contact with over the course of a day with a running total|This would help show just how quickly one person could spread or catch something when they are out in public.|
ticket connection|05/05/2020|Message everyday|Why am I being asked everyday to activate the app? I leave it live and the check each day to ensure I have registered etc. The app says it is active. The daily message is annoying. Please stop it otherwise I will turn notifications off and therefore might as well not have the app. A deluge of unnecessary notifications is annoying not helpful|
ndlehrse|01/05/2020|Too many reminders|Notifications keep popping up telling me to turn on Bluetooth and have the app running in the background - when I have done both already and am using the app correctly. This is annoying and may result in people deleting the app from frustration.|
RhiRM|30/04/2020|Needs to be open to work|This is a great app with a brilliant concept but I‚Äôm unable to multitask on my phone and still have it tracking; it doesn‚Äôt track while the app isn‚Äôt open. Would be awesome to have as a constant background tracker and be able to work with my phone locked in my pocket.|
Kellieja|27/04/2020|Turn WiFi off to verify phone number|I installed on both mine and my mums phone. No issues installing on my phone and once we turned off wifi on mums phone she was able to verify her number and install it with no issues.|
waggers05|27/04/2020|COVIDSafe|I downloaded the app with no dramas and hope that most Aussies do so too in order to help the the country get back to pre COVID conditions. One suggestion I‚Äôd love to see would be extending the app to smart watches. On many occasions I leave my phone at home as I can also use my watch as a phone.|
My cat is plotting...|27/04/2020|Easy decision.|Hints for those worried....|* The government has your details already through our tax and Medicare - just download the app.|* The app isn‚Äôt using location data just Bluetooth to see if you came near someone - just download the app.|* No one in the government is really interested in your personal conversations with your cat.

But never complain about isolation or restrictions again.|
MalcolmThe Golfer|27/04/2020|Easy to load and register then just let it run|Straight off the App Store enter a few easy details and a couple op settings to accept.|It doesn‚Äôt get much easier to help the country to get through this and once it‚Äôs going you need to do nothing.|
oxouser|26/04/2020|Turn VPN off during registration|I saw a comment that the app wouldn‚Äôt register at the phone number stage. I had the same problem but resolved it by turning off my VPN for registration. That allowed registration to happen and once I completed that I turned the VPN back on. Hope this helps üëçüèº|
TKH10011001001|26/04/2020|Error has been fixed|Just downloaded app and I was able to verify my mobile phone number and receive the pin. I left the zero off the start of my number not sure if that‚Äôs necessary though.|Working fine.|
Nigelbrown61|26/04/2020|Refuses to accept my mobile phone number|Refuses to accept my mobile number (has trouble validating my number) and no matter what format is used it shows the error message. Obviously I‚Äôm unable to register with the app until this issue is addressed.|
Joans girl|05/05/2020|Joans girl|Easy to download but can‚Äôt be used on iPhones? I‚Äôve downloaded it and applied latest update but I‚Äôm not leaving my phone unlocked all the time. I thought maybe having app open and phone locked helped but reading a lot of articles this is not the case. So basically it‚Äôs useless on iPhones. That‚Äôs sad because it‚Äôs a great helpful app for department of health in Australia.|
Vvvvg9877|26/04/2020|Easy to register|I see a lot of complaints I didn‚Äôt have a problem. I did automatically omit zero when entering my mobile number because it was in international format +61 4___________.|I am not sure if that is the issue that people have been having.|
HLCJ|26/04/2020|Nice and easy|Really simple to register clear interface.|Heard some people tried to register before 6pm on the day of launch even though it was announced it would only work from then. Assume that‚Äôs why there are some 1-star ratings but all working now.|
C@mb0|14/05/2020|Thought I Was Contributing|I registered using the app and activated left it active in the background... just happened to click on the app to see if there was any information being shared regarding local take up and I found that it requested me to register again. So now I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôve been contributing to my own safety and that of others around me?|
-Grant1964-|28/04/2020|Will only register if not on wifi|Tried 30+ times over two days to try and register the app. It kept telling me that there was a problem with the phone number I was entering. Same issue for both numbers I entered (dual sim phone). As a last resort I disconnected from my wifi and tried and it registered immediately.|The instructions need to specify that the phone cannot be on wifi to register.|
K8tie75|27/04/2020|Error verifying mobile number|I had the above error but found if I turned my wifi off and then put my number in it worked! Then went back in and turned wifi back on again!|
Therodster23|27/04/2020|What‚Äôs the problem?|The Government have your name phone number and postcode anyway. So why not use the app to help everyone? People seem ok to give these details to Facebook and dating apps but not an app that can save lives? Hmmmm makes you wonder. Do it for it for you‚Äôre community.|
supjtl|26/04/2020|Installed and Worked on Second Try|Downloaded the app and had to restart it to get it to go through the registration process successfully. All it needs it access to Bluetooth and Notifications - easy as!|
Glamourang|26/04/2020|Private business‚Äô use our data everyday for their benefit.....|I‚Äôm happy for our elected govt to have my location data for management of this as well as any future epidemics.|Big brother is watching - it‚Äôs just not the same big brother George Orwell forecast all those decades ago.|
Jemshine|12/05/2020|Laughable if it wasn‚Äôt so serious.|Doesn‚Äôt work in the background which is how we were told it would work. Endless notifications reminding me to use it - but none of them mention that the app needs be be running in the foreground of an unlocked phone to work. I downloaded this because I decided the greater good was worth the risk but it seems I‚Äôve been running nothing but a useless app in the background for data for no reason. Get this fixed!|
HugeKhloeFan|07/05/2020|Room for Improvement|Would be utilised more and more user friendly if the app could run in the background without always needing to be opened (as this drains a lot of battery and is just inconvenient). If users are able to just turn on Bluetooth and opt to have the app run in the background I believe more people would use this service.|Good idea.|
moyzie01|05/05/2020|-1 star for Bluetooth blocking|This is a great idea and hopefully saves live but unfortunately if it is running it blocks other Bluetooth devices from working correctly. If the app is running in the background on a apple device running ver 13.4.1 your watch will not connect and vehicles do not connect properly.|
Eddie852|30/04/2020|Less notifications please|Easy app to install but I am getting a notification every day telling me to keep it open and running in background. Issue is - I am receiving this notification when it is open! Please only trigger this when it isn‚Äôt open if you can!|
Maxdownunder|30/04/2020|Enough with the alerts!|App open and running and twice a day I‚Äôm getting an alert to open the app and turn my Bluetooth on. It is open and it is on. An important app we should all have but stop beating us over the head with it when we‚Äôre already doing the right thing.|
jenniferc1104|27/04/2020|do your part|Stop being paranoid of the government being able to track you that should be the least of your worries right now! The faster this is over with the quicker we can recover from this pandemic|
Coconut Icing|27/04/2020|Use different colour scheme if app is inactive|Is it worth entertaining the idea that when the app is installed but a user has not kept it active and or the Bluetooth bit is not running the app turns from its green colour scheme to another ‚Äòalerting‚Äô colour as part of its notification to the user?|
Timmydsds|26/04/2020|Great App|App works great phone verified instantly doesn‚Äôt drain battery. If you‚Äôre worried about privacy I suggest going back to your home screen and deleting every other app on your phone too.|Whatever it takes to get out country running again.|
cconcorde|26/04/2020|Quick and easy|Easy to use. No issues with phone number. As the +61 is also ready there you don‚Äôt need the ‚Äò0‚Äô at the start of the mobile number. Perhaps some people are starting with 0 rather than 4.|Let‚Äôs stop the spread!|
MonnieB11|26/04/2020|Able to register - please be patient.|Able to register with no problems. Obviously as it has just been released everything is super busy with people trying to register so please be patient and try again later!|
soleil32323|01/05/2020|Please open to other App Store locations|The app is currently only available in the AU store. However with the many international students and migrants in Australia who are still in their original country‚Äôs store there is no way for them to access and download the app even if they wanted to. Might be worth making the app available in all international stores.|
Gettung really frustrated|28/04/2020|Can‚Äôt get past phone number (without the zero)|I have been trying to set this up on my phone since it was released. I get to the screen where I put my phone number in (without the zero) then they only option I have is to click on ‚Äòget PIN‚Äô. Nothing happens just the wheel keeps spinning. I‚Äôve walked away and left it for ages and go back and it has either timed out or the wheel is still spinning. I have an iPhone 11 so phone shouldn‚Äôt be a problem.|
stt8457|27/04/2020|Error verifying mobile number|The app looks promising and could prove to be very effective in controlling the spread of virus using technology. As a responsible Australian I also wanted to contribute to the community in helping contact tracing however i gave up after trying for the whole day to register my mobile number. Every time It throws error: error verifying mobile number.|
Lord Lamington|26/04/2020|No issues|Not sure why everyone is having problems with registration but I had no issues. Verification PIN came through immediately. Enter your number without the zero in front and without spaces|
Rhys W. Powell|26/04/2020|Entirely Ineffective|Due to restrictions iOS places on Bluetooth use this app only works when it‚Äôs in the foreground and the user‚Äôs device is unlocked. The app does very little to tell users about this and even if it did it‚Äôs unlikely users would be so disciplined in using it.|Putting out an app that‚Äôs totally ineffective at contact tracing while refusing to communicate these limitations to users is dangerously irresponsible. Giving users a sense of false confidence based on a broken app is only going to cause harm.|
drstaind|26/04/2020|Mobile Number Verification|It should be made clear to users during signup that +61 substitutes the leading 0 from an Australian mobile number.|This simple clear direction will ensure that all those hundreds of people claiming the app is broken can verify their mobile number successfully and help to support the goals of the app.|
afk150|26/04/2020|Worked first time!|I‚Äôm happy to report that the first attempt at signing up for the app was successful.|It was a very simple process and I encountered zero problems.|I‚Äôm not saying that other people have not had issues but I am saying that I have had none.|
MickaJA|21/05/2020|Lauded but seems practically useless!|If this is meant to be the answer to opening up Australia then why is it so buggy and useless on iOS?!|Does NOT work with the latest iOS that has COVID-19 exposure logging it does not come up as an authorised app.|Frequently turns off and goes back to initiation registration screen.|I have a relatively new iPhone and latest iOS so I can only image the potential issues on older phones. If it means that we have to keep remembering to open the app every time we go near people that‚Äôs so impractical and in reality frequently forgotten and likely not going to happen!|The PM lauded it as a measure to opening up the country- now the developers need to get it to live up to the hype. I‚Äôm all for this to work! Let‚Äôs hope for a great update to this app!!|
phosking|08/05/2020|If it helps|I see this is a way of keeping us all safe. Pity they need an app for it. But they gotta deal with some dumb public that thinks this app tracks you or something. It uses Bluetooth which can‚Äôt be tracked. Anyway let‚Äôs all do the right thing and download it so we can get back to our lives.|
Pistashio_lord|02/05/2020|Essential|This app is essential. It is not foolproof but it is better then nothing. There is no reason not to download it and many reasons that you should download it. It is a must and more people need to use it this app is no inconvenience but it is saving lives.|
AJ986|28/04/2020|Simple and safe|Extremely straightforward to install. Very easily understood privacy policy. My RACQ app takes more personal and location data than this.|Drop your mobile number ‚Äò0‚Äô per every other comment on here.|It‚Äôll save lives.|
Callum Kraal|26/04/2020|Phone registered quickly works well|I was able to quickly register my phone number to the app. No issues not sure what is happening on other people‚Äôs mobile devices.|
Akn123|26/04/2020|Put your number in correctly people|It works fine. You need to put your mobile phone in correctly people. It picks up as a international number +61 & leave the 0 off your mobile number & it will work fine.|
Catdog2210|26/04/2020|Good and easy to install|Just turn of Wifi when putting your number in.|So it can handshake properly.|As when on wifi it can‚Äôt see your number.|Easy install no problems just have it on 4g|
Jayson fiji|26/04/2020|Come on guys!!!!|I can‚Äôt believe some people are concerned about privacy on an issue like this but only too happy to allow social media platforms to share their images location and other info with the whole world.|
DocDooom|20/05/2020|Just download it!|I am a doctor- a GP|The vast consensus of Australian GPs in this forum (currently more than 7000 members) agree that we should download this app. So please go ahead and keep us all safe.|If we can suppress this deadly virus we can breathe easy and life can go back to near normal again.|
JK007-|02/05/2020|Doubt this works on iOS|I‚Äôm very doubtful this works on iOS. My understanding is the app gets suspended when your screen locks or you press the home button. The prompt ‚Äúleave the app running‚Äú when you open it seemed ambiguous. Are we expect to open the app and constantly unlock our phones when we are out in public?|
biggayjohn|28/04/2020|Let‚Äôs work together to get back to normal life|It is a very basic app and easy questions to answer . They are not interested in your personal information . It is designed to help us all snd as Australians I‚Äôm sure we won‚Äôt our life back ü•á|
alec mack|27/04/2020|No privacy concerns|I‚Äôm the suspicious type but their Privacy Policy explains you don‚Äôt need to use your real name. Doesn‚Äôt use GPS. No address information. The only accurate information required about you is your phone number.|
G-Fru|27/04/2020|Join the fight|If you are lying in bed trying to use this app with your phone above your face then you might only see the splash screen... tilt your phone up! Looks to me like the devs switch to a low power image when you tilt the phone.|
King spastic. üòâ|26/04/2020|Good app. Let‚Äôs all support the idea people.|I did not have any problem signing up to the app|It seems though you guys are putting you number incorrectly.|Skip the 04‚Äî just put 4xxxxxxxx. And the rest of the number. Then see if it will work.|
DeltaY314|26/04/2020|Works perfectly now|Seems to have been fixed. Works perfectly well. Make sure you get everyone you know to sign up and remember to drop the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number.|
Tanialeec1|26/04/2020|You need to remove first 0 from mobile phone number|App works fine. I‚Äôve I saw numerous reviews saying it won‚Äôt accept phone number. Where you see a +61 prefix you don‚Äôt enter the first 0 of your mobile number just the remaining 9 digits.|
Yash duggal|26/04/2020|Super quick and easy set up|Not sure what others are talking about but I was able to set the app and register within few seconds. Pretty straight forward app. Would be good to see more features add up in the future.|
Victor's Girl|26/04/2020|Very simple to register|I read all the reviews that said they couldn‚Äôt enter a phone number. As they were all written before the app was activated at 6 pm on 26/4 I presume that was the issue.|I applied at 8.30 pm and got straight on. It was a very quick and easy process.|
HilsJones|26/04/2020|Seems straightforward|This is working fine for me to login. Everything seemed very straightforward to register.|I dud have some initial privacy concerns when the app was first discussed but the Bluetooth approach seems a pretty reasonable balance between tracking and privacy.|Fingers crossed it works to actually manage contact tracing easily.|
Coffscoast|26/04/2020|Family Friends school tertiary n Business|Its an app to keep our children safe at school or in tertiary institutions. Let‚Äôs us know very quickly if someone around us that has proven positive to Coronavirus and take action very quickly. All Australians need to get behind this app.|
Craig13579|09/05/2020|Useless notifications|The app produces daily notifications telling me to use the app - which I am already using. Unfortunately there seems to be no way of switching these off without switching off all notifications - which would defeat the purpose of the app.|
alittlebitdifferent|27/04/2020|Cyclists often only have smart watches - just a thought.|The app seems straight forward however outside of grocery shopping we only leave our home for exercise - When exercising we often only carry a smart watch. Are you missing low hanging interactions ( eg: grabbing a takeaway coffee at the end of a ride ) by only having a phone app.|
Ches<3|26/04/2020|Very simple to set up|Some people have complained it‚Äôs hard to set up and can‚Äôt put their phone number in. Thus they have given it a 1star rating. I think they must have fixed it all now as it worked without a hitch.|
gregoryw9|26/04/2020|Works as it should|Not sure why it didn‚Äôt work for others but mine worked fine mobile phone not an issue. Hope we‚Äôre all patient and this gets going so Aussie is #1 in the world where we should be!|
mummytan|26/04/2020|Take off the 0 in your phone number|Those people saying the phone number won‚Äôt accept ... whenever you enter a +61 phone number you take the 0 off.|Setup takes less than a minute|
Kaz45327|26/04/2020|Registration was a breeze|Took less that 2 minutes to install on both household mobile phones. Very easy and notifications seem to work fine when Bluetooth is turned off (I tested it out)|
Koolkaid|26/04/2020|Had to wait to enter phone number|Downloaded straight away on first day but couldn‚Äôt register phone number. Came back after 6pm (when they said it would be active) and it worked|
tc eg btjgnkk|26/04/2020|Too easy|Completed in about 2 min after reading information. No problem with verifying my mobile number. Remember to drop the first 0 when entering your number! Let‚Äôs hope it works.|
Charamil|26/04/2020|Awesome recommend for anyone who wants to go outside.|Only errors if you downloaded before 6pm. They said it would be ready from 6pm for anyone that wants to leave the house in 2020. Otherwise please do not leave your house for the next 8 months.|
xander y|26/04/2020|Easy to install|Reviews who said they could not upload their phone numbers didn‚Äôt wait until the 6pm launch time today. Try again guys - so we can all get back to some kind of normal life|
GordieTas|26/04/2020|Save lives and get us off restrictions sooner|Speed up the process for tracing infected people compared with hours or days for manual tracing. Don‚Äôt be a boofhead install it if you want to save lives and speed up loosening restrictions and get people back to work sooner.|
jsargeant3133|26/04/2020|Won‚Äôt let me verify my phone number|I put in my phone number but it says an error occurred in verifying my phone number and asked me to check my details again. It‚Äôs definitely correct please fix this so I can use the app!|
TsarOfAR|26/04/2020|Error verifying mobile|Great idea but getting error ‚ÄúError verifying phone number‚Äù when registering (using a valid australian mobile tried both with and without the leading zero). I‚Äôm sure your developers will have this fixed lightening fast.|
OzOwais|07/05/2020|Map|It would be great if this app shows us the map and places we have been to in past few weeks.|As long as it is helping all of us I am happy to keep it as long as we need it. We have to fight together to beat Covid-19.|
Fergie390|02/05/2020|Enough with the notifications|It‚Äôs the like boy who cried wolf. I‚Äôve got the app my Bluetooth is on I don‚Äôt need reminders everyday to keep it on. Keep the notifications only for when you need them please or at least let people opt out of different types of notifications.|
GetSwanny|28/04/2020|Failed|A really important initiative I support and encourage all to use however failed to be able to verify phone number of mobile I‚Äôve been using for 10 years plus. Dropped 0 and added 0 (due +61) but no joy. Appreciate advice on issue or fix. Also if it makes a difference to loading app the + 61 will confuse those who haven‚Äôt travelled overseas previously which could delay / stop sign ups. Suggest ‚ÄòHelp Tip‚Äô on this point. Keep up the good work everyone.|
Corbaisru|27/04/2020|Not recognising number - turn off wifi|Update: worked once I turned off wifi.|‚ÄùSame problem as others the app will not recognise my phone number with or without the 0.‚Äù One star|
Counter Canter|26/04/2020|Easy to install|Easy to install. Didn‚Äôt have any issues verifying my mobile number. Drop the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number. Let‚Äôs hope this works at reducing the spread of COVID-19 and helping society get back to the new normal.|
KelvinAU|26/04/2020|20 second install.|No dramas registering with my iPhone. There‚Äôs also a great technical analysis on Twitter if you want to know the internal workings of the app. Sounds pretty similar to the papers released by Google and Apple on how they will natively allow support States/Govs to do contact tracing.|Doing my part to stop the spread of COVID-19.|
Godders69|26/04/2020|Muppets with mobile number verify issue|To all the muppets who can‚Äôt verify their mobile number it‚Äôs because you are a muppet not that the app is broken.|I guess you‚Äôve never been overseas before.|When your number is prefixed with +61 you drop the zero at the start of your mobile number.|ENTER YOUR PHONE NUMBER WITHOUT THE ZERO AT THE START.|
Steff.tac|26/04/2020|Leave 0 away when entering phone number|Everything from downloading to registration went without any problems at all. Remember to leave 0 away when entering your phone number.|
Javaerz|26/04/2020|For all the future whingers|You‚Äôre willing to give up ‚Äúfreedoms‚Äù to giant US tech corporations who where you have very little recourse but you‚Äôre worried about an update that collects not even half the data.|Get real download it and move onto your next Netflix binge.|
Calacode|26/04/2020|Give it a go ...|Look it‚Äôs worth to use this app if we can recover as a country better due to COVID-19. For people concerned about privacy this app is no worst than you using FacebookGoogle services or TikTok sharing all your personal-information and random photos/socials.|
jacklc162|26/04/2020|Great app just remember to leave it open.|Easy sign up and works perfectly. Will just be a bit inconvenient to remember to have the app open all the time for it to work however it is definitely worth it.|
creatiu|16/05/2020|Doing my part to stop the spread!|Despite all the misinformation going around about COVIDSafe I have no doubt this is the most effective way for each of us to contribute to stopping the spread and going back to normal. Join the fight and help our health authorities trace and contain future breakouts.|
miladaraujo|30/04/2020|Glitches & glitches! App doesn‚Äôt work|I have downloaded the app and all I see is the black screen that says ‚ÄúCOVIDSafe‚Äù. When I try to switch apps the screen with the explanations appears but when I go back to the app the black screen is still there and it doesn‚Äôt let me select any options or proceed. Basically I cannot use the app. I have tried closing and opening the app but still the same black ‚ÄúCOVIDSafe‚Äù screen that doesn‚Äôt let me do anything.|
Channi76|29/04/2020|Bluetooth dropouts|So I like the idea of this app but it sends you a notification if your Bluetooth happens to drop our reminding you to check that it‚Äôs connected! Kind of annoying especially if it happens daily. Also it would be great if it linked with the other gov one so it recognises that you already have the alert app active!|
BearBait2011|28/04/2020|Turn WiFi off to register.|We need good contact tracing to reopen society I‚Äôm very supportive of this apps purpose & keen that the target of 10 million people download this.|To register turn OFF WiFi. Don‚Äôt enter the leading zero of your mobile number.|

anon_@&$|27/04/2020|Technology clash|Constant Bluetooth search by the app for nearby devices severely interferes with performance of other Bluetooth technologies in vicinity eg computer peripherals. Have to turn Phone (and therefore covidsafes) Bluetooth to be able to continue to work. This then requires me to actually remember to turn it on again when leaving the house. Not a great user experience|
patschwarz_|27/04/2020|I trust them|I trust the government in trying to stop the spread - in full support of this app and thankful that they have released it so soon it works well and uses bluetooth to locate you - not location services!! stay home save lives and stop the spread !!|
Rater 0123|27/04/2020|Easy to register obvious privacy concern|It‚Äôs simple to setup and explains everything well. Obviously there is a privacy concern to the app but if handled well it shouldn‚Äôt be an issue. It appears that many of the negative reviews here are due to people trying to register before verification opened causing errors.|
Mike-55|26/04/2020|Pretty simple to install|I presume the app will do what it says and only time will tell if the data is as secure as they say. Very easy to install. Suspect the large number of 1 Star reviews are from ignorant people who put potential privacy above the health of the community.|
Leigh1988|26/04/2020|Works fine|Everyone reporting they couldn‚Äôt register their mobile didn‚Äôt read that they had to wait until 6pm to register. It works fine. P.S. always keep the app open in the background.|
the ovarc's|26/04/2020|Too easy!|Downloaded and signed up within a couple of mins.|Looks well designed app and hope it and I can play my part to keep all safe and get back to some kind of normal.|As a chauffeur driver it‚Äôs great to know if I have been exposed.|
ALXBY|26/04/2020|Can verify phone number|People really need to read info provided for when the software will be switched on.|App was released a few hours before the servers were switched on that enabled mob numbers to be verified.|App works perfectly üòÄ|
Astory-89|26/04/2020|Privacy Policy looks pretty good|The app uses Bluetooth not GPS and data is only stored on your phone until you manually upload your information.|Looks like good secuirty and able to make contact tracing much easier for the health officials.|
TFRJennings|26/04/2020|Great initiative but not useful if it doesn‚Äôt work in the background.|It makes me sad that the Government wait for the Apple & Google framework to be released. The gain in having it work in the background would have been worth a few additional weeks in my eyes.|It‚Äôs a bit worrying that people might develop a false sense of security and take more risks. The home screen literally has a pulsating shield.|Please be transparent about why the decision was made to not use the Apple & Google framework.|
ghhftjuthj bikd|04/05/2020|Notifications?|I think it‚Äôs a great idea however all the notifications are alarming. Eg daily messages saying to have your Bluetooth on etc. just now I got a text saying to download the app I already have. Worried I won‚Äôt be paying attention when a real notification occurs.|
Andy987s|01/05/2020|Tried and uninstalled|Whilst the app is an excellent idea the implementation leaves a lot to be desired.|The daily ‚Äòalert‚Äô messages which are just advertising were distracting and annoying.|I disabled alerts for the app and then the app said they are required.|There is no explanation why and of course the government has gone back on its promise to open source the app and release an independent security audit report.|So thanks but no thanks.|
rasthasan|28/04/2020|Definitely the one to download!|Media promised me that it‚Äôs for our own good! They said ‚Äúthe app won‚Äôt track you *it simply digitises where you‚Äôve been and who you‚Äôve been in contact with* ‚Äù|See it‚Äôs totally different! They just want to know where you go and who you talk to. That‚Äôs all. Nothing to see here! Nothing fishy about that at all|Guess who got the contract to ‚Äústore the data‚Äù?

Tahnei31|27/04/2020|Help!|Want to have the app; but unfortunately I do not do the ow have a mobile number but I do have an iPhone that I carry around.(self funding issue) without verifying a mobile number I can‚Äôt get the app? Maybe add an email option üëçüèΩ|
loveandsunshine|27/04/2020|Expiry of verification number needs to be slower|Happy to help elderly family with the installation of this important app.|My feedback is that the verification number expires too quickly and they were unable to get it entered within the time limit. Can the expiry be extended or can a different verification be used so that all Australians who want to do their bit are able to participate.|Otherwise well done!|
Mariobrother2012|27/04/2020|Useful app|My only gripe is that the upload my information button should have had a few steps/warnings before allowing to press the button.|I can lots of people clicking that button accidentally and then being told they are positive.|
Fionalota|26/04/2020|Works perfectly|I downloaded the app and setup ID on first night of release. Smooth easy process. No problems with verification. Wonderful to have this app to assist in contact tracing. I highly recommend it. Keeps us all safe!|
jascoecho|26/04/2020|Signup works fine|Just so need up use the last 9 digits of my mobile number (dropped the zero at the start) got the test straight away and now have the app up and running. Perhaps there was an issue with everyone signing up at the start at the same time?|
Lachlan91|26/04/2020|Easy to use|For me the installation worked perfectly. No problems verifying my mobile number. I‚Äôm sure that any issues for others will be resolved in the next 24 hours|
James_jaems|26/04/2020|Works great - let‚Äôs keep Australia safe|As was announced the app allows you to register after 6pm today. Very quick and easy to install and register.|No issues to report from me. Thank you Aus government for doing all you can to keep us safe.|
varbazza123|26/04/2020|Everyone should download it|Everyone should download this app to contribute in saving lives.|To the many people reporting an error with the app accepting phone number. That was because at that time registration had not yet been opened .|
10 star person|26/04/2020|Creative solution - super easy to sign up|A smart creative way to help #stopthespread and to get Australia moving again. Was happily surprised at how swift and easy it is to setup. From clicking download to being done took less than 30 seconds.|
JR syd|26/04/2020|Can‚Äôt register|I‚Äôve tried to register using my mobile number which I‚Äôve had for over a decade. Get ‚Äúerror verifying phone number‚Äù message. Have tried multiple times with and without ‚Äú0‚Äù. Not a great start.|
cmascord|02/05/2020|Interferes with hands free and other Bluetooth devices|The app is simple enough to register but the Bluetooth keeps preventing my phone from pairing with hands free in car and other Bluetooth devices. I generally have to either shutdown the app or go into my phone settings every time I get in the car to pair with hands free. Not only is this annoying but could be a safety issue for people driving.|
Smythe99|27/04/2020|Must have iOS 10+|Fine for me but my mum in her 70s uses an old iPhone 4 hand me down and can‚Äôt download it due to software limitations.

feher44|27/04/2020|Finally got it working|For anyone getting the error saying invalid details when entering their phone number. I was having the same troubles (yes even when I didn‚Äôt put 0 at the front). I tried using my mobile data instead of wifi and it work first go! All fast and simple apart from this weird glitch|
Ruby Guthrie|27/04/2020|Very good!|This app is one of the best ideas the government has had so far! It is easy to download and once you have done that You don‚Äôt have to do anything else!|Stay safe!|Ps. Everyone wash your hands and only go out of your house if you need too!|
Ozplayer|26/04/2020|App Registration opened at 6pm AEST time|To respond to all the comments where people couldn‚Äôt register their mobile number the accompanying Government release advised people to download and then register from 6pm AEST Sunday night. App registers seamlessly. Try again if you couldn‚Äôt register pre-6pm.|
Allguff|26/04/2020|Quick and simple to set up|Super easy to navigate through the 3-4 steps to set up the app. Once it‚Äôs installed and you‚Äôve given the expected permissions you just let it run in the background and it will do its thing.|
gobbl3dock|26/04/2020|Issue accepting phone number to register|On first try the app didn‚Äôt work. Each time I entered my phone number despite trying variations with and without leading zero I would get an error message saying the phone number was invalid.|However it worked on a retry after leaving it for about 30 mins and restarting the app.|
Bozmond|08/05/2020|Covid 19|I do not know why this is not enforced in Australia as legal requirement our data is trusted with apple google Samsung and iPhone.... but not the government|When our data is leaked by these companies we go to the government to protect us through OAIC or lawyers who are enforced by government and Australian laws / constitutions|
DavePook|28/04/2020|Such a good idea|Just keeps a list of the phones you were near in the last 3 weeks using Bluetooth. Only uploads if you tell it to. If we can trace all the contacts of people who get the virus we can beat this.|
KJRPerth|27/04/2020|Works really well so far|Nothing to lose only things to gain by using this. I develop this stuff for a living so I can tell you it's safe. The government isn't going to know more about you than they already do.|

Brizman|27/04/2020|Well done!|Brilliant install but may need clarification on two points:|Drop the first 0 when adding your mobile number|Keeping the app running...? I presume it runs in the background as long as I don‚Äôt delete it.|

Jamesk811|04/05/2020|Does not work on iOS unless you leave app open in foreground|Useless on iOS unless you change your display settings for the screen to constantly stay on and also make sure the app is always open in the foreground. If you don‚Äôt do this After a certain amount of time of running in the background Bluetooth stops working. This is a purpose built safety feature of iOS devices.|
Kiwi brisvegas|29/04/2020|Serves its purpose to a degree|I think 1.5m doesn‚Äôt seem enough. If you put your phone on a bench it‚Äôs not going to be very accurate. It‚Äôs ok if you have your phone on your body all the time.

Soprano#|29/04/2020|Moi|Today there was a msg on my screen when I opened my phone saying ‚ÄúWe have reset you..‚Äù but blinked off before I could read the rest. The app is now not operating properly and not showing info long enough to read anything. I deleted and reinstalled it but no success. It was fine since installing initially until today. NOW its wanting a nickname and telling me all my choices are taken! Surely the review is more important than a nickname!!!|
Mr Setek|29/04/2020|Stop notifying me for no reason|Notifications every morning at 9am that are what ‚Äúfriendly reminders‚Äù? It‚Äôs already on and in background.

Userufcuvyivryvi|26/04/2020|SMS registration is working now|It‚Äôs important that we all install this app! Please disregard the previous comments regarding SMS not working.

Maybe test the app first with handful of users prior asking public to use it.|
WillPressYesWithoutReading|26/04/2020|I feel safer already|When I walk down to Bondi and see everyone not social distancing I think to myself ‚Äúlet‚Äôs nuke the site from orbit‚Äù.

xxxLisaReviewxxx|04/05/2020|Doesn‚Äôt work on my iPhone|I have deleted this app as it does not work on my iPhone. I leave my Bluetooth on and the app open in the background but it keeps telling me I have turned my Bluetooth off or they need me to keep Australia safe and to open the app. This happens even after a few minutes.

JTango18|27/04/2020|Not effective on iOS|While I applaud the Governments attempt to get this app in to the hands of Aussie citizens the technical reality is that in its current state this app is useless. The technical constraints within iOS mean that this app must be open and in the foreground to function. The second that you do something else like open another app take a phone call or lock your phone; this app no longer works at all. A disappointing false start.|
maddie323232|27/04/2020|Fine|From a UX point of view I wish they had of led with the why and not the how to begin with when installing the app. An overwhelming amount of information at the beginning and having to swipe through all of that didn‚Äôt make the key message clear or incentivise installation.

Peter3579|27/04/2020|Read the fine print.|I was under the impression the data this app generates and my personal information would only be used for COVID19 tracking.

Luckephil|26/04/2020|Worked first time|I don‚Äôt understand the reviews saying they couldn‚Äôt get past the verify telephone screen. Perhaps they were entering the leading ‚Äú0‚Äù of their phone number when not required.|
Caitlin-R-M|26/04/2020|The app is going to save lives.|The app works perfectly people were just whinging about it not working because they were trying to log in before it officially opened|
izzygelato|26/04/2020|Worked perfectly|Not sure why there is lot of bad reviews. Worked perfectly first time and no issues whatsoever. Thank you for doing this amazing app to help the stress of an outbreak to notify anyone who may need to get tested.|
pcd01|26/04/2020|Worked first time|No problem at all with registering - I'm probably stating the obvious here (no doubt) but for people experiencing issues registering phone number please ensure you remove the 0 from the mobile number!|
Evanhumble88|26/04/2020|Needs super spreader reporting|Would be good to be able to report when near sniffy coughing people and if that reported person ends up being a super spreader give them legal penalties. Think major problem is symptomatic people not isolating need to be taught a lesson.|

Ruadhaidh|26/04/2020|Easy very easy!|Very straightforward to register. Sensible permissions and privacy steps. Confirmation by SMS instantaneous. I think other reviewers must have been overly impatient to write off an app within a few minutes of the 6pm (according to SMH) launch.|

@MichaelQ|26/04/2020|Just Do It|Registration for this started 6pm Sydney time - after it was available for download. So if it wasn‚Äôt working for you before try registering now.|Absolutely download and run this. This will save greater than zero lives.|
valgal81|26/04/2020|Can‚Äôt complete registration|Tried to register my phone/details and the app won‚Äôt accept my phone number. Tried it the 2 different ways it could possibly be entered & it doesn‚Äôt work. Partner tried to register also on his phone & had the same issue can‚Äôt get passed the phone number part.|
Phatchants|20/05/2020|Stop WE NEED YOU! Notifications|Pls don‚Äôt keep reminding me to keep the app on and Bluetooth on. It‚Äôs repetitive. I‚Äôm very happy to help and would like to keep notifications on in case something important needs to be communicated. But every two days or so is a bit much.|
EG1976|09/05/2020|There‚Äôs a problem|When I leave the app alone and when I get a notification saying to check if the app is still active it takes me to the screen where I set up my details over again. This happened to me like 3 times now. Maybe even more. Fix this pronto please.|
1980KC|04/05/2020|Bluetooth messages|The Bluetooth message sent out every morning could possibly lead to people ignoring messages from the app in the morning deeming it‚Äôs just the same message when it could actually be a health warning.|
Zoota2000|03/05/2020|Keeps forgetting my details|Downloaded the app put in my details left it running in the background but then a day later I start getting messages from the app that I should sign up etc. Did this three times now and the same thing keeps happening! Very annoying.|
1633118|01/05/2020|Wifi problem|Wouldn‚Äôt send a pin at first because I had the wifi on using my home internet but once I turned wifi off the setup was easy.|
MeetupUser125|28/04/2020|Great initiative needs some work|This is a great initiative to see from the government. As a developer I know that there are tools from Apple being made available to make sure this app can run in the background this app really needs to make use of them to make sure that this app is as effective as it can be|
Bobjaan|27/04/2020|Doesn‚Äôt lock the screen|The app seems to work but it doesn‚Äôt lock the screen. This can be a major security issue. The advise is to ‚Äúkeep the app running‚Äù. This will not be a good user experience to be forced to keep this app on the foreground let alone remember to do it whenever we go out shopping.|
LetsGetOutAustralia|27/04/2020|Download to end the restrictions|Easy to install. Asks to send notifications. OK. Asks to use Bluetooth. OK. Does NOT ask to use location services! Please Download and leave running in the background so we can get back to normal Australia!|
bc626381737|26/04/2020|Let‚Äôs all get on board.|Registration worked fine with no problems at all very quick and easy to install. Let‚Äôs all help each other to beat this virus. Install now.|
QFR2013|26/04/2020|Works fine|Just downloaded the app and registered. Took less than 5 minutes. Lots of comments about phone numbers- leave the 0 off and no spaces.|
Daniel!6829|26/04/2020|It‚Äôs working|I just downloaded the app and the process was very easy I didn‚Äôt get the ‚Äòcannot verify your phone‚Äô error everyone else is talking about. It took me 3 min to set up user friendly.|
Casey Fulton|26/04/2020|No issues works perfectly|No idea what is wrong with the other people leaving reviews. Are they entering their phone number incorrectly? Worked perfectly for me straight away.|
Drtsjbyerley|26/04/2020|COVIDSafe|The app launched at 6pm but was available on the App Store earlier than that. If you couldn‚Äôt verify your mobile number probably you were trying before the 6pm start time. Try again now.|
Jam9er|26/04/2020|Runs well in background and quick to set up.|Updated IOS before installing and it was a quick registration once installed. It is running well in background.|
Cicada_Girl_123|13/05/2020|App is draining my iPhone battery!!|I am very supportive of this app but it is draining my battery every day and I got caught short with no charge.|I have tried stopping in t and then putting back on when I left the house but found that I kept forgetting to start it each time so have been leaving running.|
annoyed and blah|12/05/2020|App issues no way to tell them|Hey|Believe in the idea of the app!|This app made all my other Bluetooth devices connect to the phone stop working.|I tried it on three different days and times it‚Äôs 100% this app.|Also I can‚Äôt find a way to tell the app developer other than this review?!?? Such a important time for This app and they fail to open communication|
scotia-thismonkey|07/05/2020|Cannot register my phone number|Irrespective of the merits of benefits of such an app my poor rating is because for me the app is useless. I cannot register my mobile number and so cannot participate in the program.|The developers also deserve a low rating because of the lack of detail in the revision history. Simply saying ‚Äúbug fixes‚Äù gives me no indication that I should upgrade. It‚Äôs a lazy behaviour that many develops exhibit.|
wantohelp|28/04/2020|Can‚Äôt get PIn|Re install the application twice still can‚Äôt get PIN for the mobile phone. Try both with and without leading zero for my phone no.|Disappointing!|At the end I noticed my phone is on WiFi call as my mobile carrier is the same as the NBN at home. Do I turned off my phone WiFi and ask for the pin again. Then it works. May be the software needs to work with WiFi phone at home.|
Kkaiah|28/04/2020|We‚Äôre all in this together! Great App!|Wouldn‚Äôt let me verify my mobile number at 1st. So for some of those having same trouble...|I turned off my phones wifi then it worked üëç|
Blackyshark|28/04/2020|You must turn wifi off to get the pin|Happy to do my bit but that instruction would have been handy rather than spender three hours trying to get the pin|
GregWS|27/04/2020|Clunky. Needs fixing.|Want to be a pandemic contributor. Easy download. Easy signup using Alias. Can‚Äôt read Privacy Notice as app keeps darkening screen as I read. Did not finish reading PN. Red flag 1. I use other apps a lot during the day. Do I need to open this app after each use? Who knows? The app won‚Äôt tell me. Wants to be open 24/7? Red flag 2. A clunky app. It has one week on my iPhone then it‚Äôs kaput.|
random name hdhfhftggdggdfhhg|27/04/2020|Do it for everyone‚Äôs safety|The more people who download it the sooner we can get back to normality.|Most people give way far far more personal details on social media. This app asks for very little info.|
Frisby donut|27/04/2020|Do your part to stop this virus|Loads easy don‚Äôt worry about your location privacy it‚Äôs a little price to pay for such a huge benefit ( savings lives livelihoods and our beautiful country)|
ShellieBeach|26/04/2020|Quick and easy|No problems at all - Don‚Äôt know why so many people have had issues. All good here. Hopefully it gets smoothed out soon if it is a broader issue. Please be patient everyone.|
izington|26/04/2020|Easy to use|I think people are making the mistake when entering their mobile number of putting the full number in. Take your first digit off as the +61 replaces it. Common sense really|
shaze77|26/04/2020|Easy to register|Worked perfectly if you followed the instructions in the press release and waited until 6pm to register (which clearly many didn‚Äôt!).|
Picjunki|26/04/2020|All working fine so far|Straightforward. No issues verifying my mobile number. Not sure what the complaints were about. Glad to be doing this for the greater good of our society.|
1kanda|26/04/2020|The app works and will hopefully save lives even the idiots.|The app works the problem of the phone number verification has been fixed.|Hopefully it will save lives even the morons|
Sophie13579000|26/04/2020|Easy to set up|Took less than 30 seconds to set up. Phone verification now working. The more people that download the quicker we can return to something resembling normality.|
secjac|26/04/2020|Mobile number|When entering your mobile number you have to only enter the numbers after the 0. Don‚Äôt not enter the 0 just the last 9 numbers|
Nick-ACT|26/04/2020|Works as advertised|Saw many 1-star reviews here because people couldn‚Äôt register. Worked without a glitch for me will keep this app on for the next couple of months.|
colhavek1837|06/05/2020|App active or not|Had downloaded the app on the night it was released and had thought the app was active with blue tooth on. Now nearly 2 weeks later while discussing this with my daughter we discovered that my app was not active. APPARENTLY the app needs to stay green on the whole phone screen.|I‚Äôm very disappointed that this is not explained on the green screen and if you do close the screen there is no warning that the device is now inactive.|I had been getting texts saying to keep the app on with Bluetooth however think is is a standard text sent to everyone.|Also this review won‚Äôt allow a nick name easily says names are taken. Over and over again.|Not Happy. üò°|
Hussein Nur|03/05/2020|Help us to go back work and schools|Please let us tel our family and friends to download this app because I am sure if everyone in Australia download everything back to normal. Thanks.|
wwwazzzz|03/05/2020|Great idea let‚Äôs all sign up but turn off daily notifications|We want all Australians to use this app but many will delete it if you keep up with the annoying daily reminders to have it switched on.|
Monique.1900|02/05/2020|Doesn‚Äôt work on iPhone 6|Downloaded the app followed all instructions and continuously shows my Bluetooth as off (although it is on) and does not allow me to consent to ‚ÄúAllow Bluetooth‚Äù at all. I‚Äôve deleted and reloaded app and tried all suggestions. Nothing had worked.|Total fail for me. Idea was good but execution for iPhone for me was a complete fail.|Here‚Äôs hoping other iPhone users have better success.|
Ajhsndndndnsn|30/04/2020|App doesn‚Äôt save login|Titles says it app will make you sign up again every few days. Unsure wether it‚Äôs actually doing any tracking while it‚Äôs offline but seems a bit pointless me needing to signup again so often. If the app developers can‚Äôt figure out how to save a login token on a device I doubt their ability to securely store peoples sensitive data.|
covid preventer|28/04/2020|Anything to help stop the spread and protect Australians|This is one step to reducing the spread of covid -19 and I am happy to use this application knowing the safety of my data and l knowing I am working with many other Australians to prevent the spread that will undoubtedly safe lives.|
BenB.au|28/04/2020|Easy to install - happy to use this app|Works well. Happy to use this and help watch the Covid numbers go down. Let‚Äôs do our bit and save lives and get the pubs open safely again!|
Raaaaah?!|27/04/2020|Raaaaah?!|If you are having trouble getting the app to verify your phone make sure you are not using wifi calling. Wouldn‚Äôt verify for me until I turned wifi off.|
AminB|27/04/2020|Easy to save a life|Very easy to install only took a minute and all work without issue. Something so simple to help protect my family and I and hopefully get us out of lockdown sooner is a no-brainer!|
horizontal07|27/04/2020|Lets Make This Work|Great idea. It will help you get an early warning of contact with a confirmed case so you can warn your family fellow workers friends and health workers. Encourage and help everyone to install this app and to keep it running.|
PBaini|26/04/2020|Install & Mobile Registration|Installed and register my mobile and my parents mobile without any issues.|Quick and easy process.üëç|
Agatokki|26/04/2020|Great way to protect each other!|No issues with installing for iPhone. Mobile number registration went without any issues. Thank you everyone for your tireless work and effort to protect Australia from Covid-19! üôè|
Penkat|26/04/2020|Working perfectly|Downloaded and registered with my mobile number in less than 10 minutes.|Melbourne.|
nocoronapls|26/04/2020|Do your bit and download this!!|Took me 30 seconds to set up! So easy - everyone should be getting on to this so we can go back to normal faster and help protect our most vulnerable|
Horse1975|26/04/2020|For those who can‚Äôt verify their number...|For those who can‚Äôt get past the mobile number verification just leave off the first zero of your number.|
Garrethhh|26/04/2020|It is ready now|If you tried earlier to setup it would not have worked they said ready after 6pm. All working well now. Support Australia getting back to normal by installing this app.|
Bosko73|26/04/2020|Works on both our iPhones|For those that had errors potentially was before the govt switched in registrations. Try again. Worked first go on both of our iPhones.|
Ben Rae|26/04/2020|Set-up worked fine|No problems with setting up the app. But the instruction to keep the app running when you‚Äôre out is ambiguous. Does that mean the app has to be open or can it run in the background while I‚Äôm using another app?|
alexzro|26/04/2020|Seems to work|For a first version 1.00 government app works smoothly and I didn‚Äôt had problems in logging my data into it. I gave it 5 star but we‚Äôll see if it‚Äôs worth that much.|
Domain12321|26/04/2020|Can‚Äôt easily search for app on AppStore|If you didn‚Äôt know the name of the app and you searched for the term ‚Äúcovid app Australia‚Äù then you get a different app. Because this other app is from government I can see where a lot of people will download it and think they are done.|
Whycantijustuseanon|26/04/2020|Works fine|Works fine easy to register. Everyone who is saying it didn‚Äôt work it was because it wasn‚Äôt going ‚Äúlive‚Äù to enter your mobile number until 6pm EST.|
Sammied81|26/04/2020|Don‚Äôt put in 0 for phone number|For those having trouble registering don‚Äôt but the first 0 in for your phone number! Start with the 4 this is why you can‚Äôt complete registration|
BijouAmira|26/04/2020|Great initiative|Wonderful initiative by the Australian government taking us another step closer to being able to ease lockdown message and keep everyone safe. The more of us cooperate the quicker we‚Äôll get this curse under control.|
AddsyO|28/04/2020|Stuck on phone number entry|Found that I needed to turn my wifi off for the pin to come through and get past the phone number stage. Just for anyone that may be having issues.|
ViktoriaAnneD|28/04/2020|Unable to sign up due to error sending pin|I was unable to sign up for this app due to the fact that it says ‚Äúerror‚Äù when attempting to text a pin to my phone. However when I turned my wifi off and on again it worked!|
Ptc1950|27/04/2020|Good app|I read the privacy information and quite frankly sounds more secure than most of the apps I have on my phone. Quite frankly if ASIO CIA NAC. or any other spook outfit want to know how many tines I go to woolies or Coles in a week they really need to get a life!!|
Lobotto|27/04/2020|Great but I think the 15min is too long|Great but I think the 15min is too long would be better if it was 5 or 10 min. That would be more than enough time to catch the virus from someone.|
Tippys1963|26/04/2020|Perfect|I had no problems installing..many here did but I think it‚Äôs because they forgot to drop the zero when entering their mobile phone number..|
head...........|26/04/2020|Mobile number needs the leading 0 to verify.|Make sure you put the leading 0 in your mobile number when verifying. Besides from that it just does what it says.|
Fearnzie|26/04/2020|Drop the first 0 when entering your phone number|Because the phone number you enter is prefixed with +61 you need to drop the first ‚Äú0‚Äù of your mobile number when entering it|
Sac8881984|26/04/2020|Mobile rego worked for me|Great idea hope the issues others are facing have been quickly fixed. It worked for me straight away.|
GirlPeta|26/04/2020|Very quick and easy.|From previous reviews they have obviously made the updates to correct the registration issues|
nrou5698|26/04/2020|Fantastic|Safe efficient effective way to help us to continue to lead the world in the covid19 response. Privacy concerns are silly encourage everyone to download this to do their bit to help us open up again ASAP|
Psarrami|26/04/2020|Could not set in- solved|This problem was solved after I tried again an hour later:|When I tried to get the pin by mobile I got an error message that I need to check my details and try again.|
elliebaba22|26/04/2020|Unable to access|Trying to put my phone number in and it won‚Äôt allow me to saying there is an error with my details.|
Geegina65|15/05/2020|Easy.......Thank you|Happy to install it and happy to know if we come in contact with someone who has virus.|If only everyone was as sensible as us. Too many people spreading dangerous misinformed conspiracy theories.|Happy to be sensible and not paranoid ‚ù§Ô∏èüòá|
Fester1952|12/05/2020|Needs a smart watch app|I have no objection to using the Covidsafe app on my phone but why is there no Apple Watch app? I generally wear my watch when out and about more so than carrying my phone.|
illawong60|11/05/2020|App works fine please remove daily reminder|No issues installing or running since day 1 of release. Please though stop the daily reminder that the app is running when I have never closed it|
FuzzBot123|30/04/2020|Unclear if ‚Äòopen‚Äô means foreground or don‚Äôt kill|The Singapore version of this app requires it to be kept in the foreground and says that. This version says ‚Äòopen‚Äô and the minister has said it has fixed the problems that require foreground.|Can we get an answer as to if it needs to be in the foreground to work?|
Dboychocdude|28/04/2020|Don‚Äôt be skeptically about getting this app! It‚Äôs for the good of you and I|Don‚Äôt see the reason why I shouldn‚Äôt download this app! Some say the government are going to monitor what I do and I reply I have no fear for that unless I am dodgy|
Kazzsam22|27/04/2020|Trouble signing up with phone number|I have been trying for four hours to log in and when I get to entering my mobile it comes up with error recognising phone number. I have tried turning phone off tried entering mobile number without the zero and still nothing. If this type of error occurs at the beginning then how can we trust the app to give true readings.|Very frustrated.|
Kalifire|27/04/2020|Shares nothing not already known|Don‚Äôt be put off by the fearful and ill-informed. For all the paranoid conspiracy theories the fact is this app shares nothing not already known. This will help Australia get back on track. I‚Äôm happy and confident to use this app.|
jayhua|27/04/2020|improvement|wish it can turn off Bluetooth while staying home or alone to save energy|
Hashman-84|27/04/2020|Works perfect|Worked fine on my XR. Very easy setup.|I particularly liked that I can put a fake name. I guess the Govt only need to know location and other app users in my radius when I am out and about.|
Littlelyn1|26/04/2020|Phone no|Please note that to enter your mobile number with +61 in front you have to drop the 0|I entered my number and accessed the app straight away.|All done now and I feel a lot safer now.|
Pbuff18|26/04/2020|Keep us safe!|Easy sign up had no troubles at all. It‚Äôs great to see something like this come in effect to protect us all and help get our way of life back to normal and get the economy back up and going!|
Rebecca Phillips|26/04/2020|Worked fine|Downloaded and all worked fine. Registered my mobile without any issues|
MorleyMadHouse|26/04/2020|Works well for me|Lots of people saying it won‚Äôt accept the mobile. For me it was seamless and worked first time - so maybe a bug was fixed. Suggest people try again.|
Absolutely A Musr|26/04/2020|Easy To Use|Really happy to do my bit to help reduce communal transmission of this awful virus. Let‚Äôs join together to prevent a second wave that could be worse than what we have seen. Look at Singapore ..|
easyreg|26/04/2020|Easy to register|Don‚Äôt know what the others are on about easy to register. +61 is there use remove the 0 from your mobile number and enter from the 4 onwards|
I_don't_like_ads|26/04/2020|Thank you|Thank you for creating this app to keep us safe during these times! People are saying they can‚Äôt get past the phone number step but I did.|
myangelmydestiny|26/04/2020|üòå|I had no problems downloading this app verified number with no hassles. When you add your mobile remember to leave the number zero (0) out. Lets see how it works when I leave my house which is once every 10 days ü§£|
Jolyon's Review|26/04/2020|Easy To Set Up|Set this up in a few minutes. Had no trouble with registering phone number. Hope this technology helps keep the numbers down.|

kai_h|21/05/2020|Well this app get an update to support the new Exposure Notification API from Apple and Google?|This morning Apple released iOS 13.5 that features the new Exposure Notification API. In order to greatly increase the usefulness of this app it needs to use this API to protect users privacy and allow the app to run in the background.|
charliejaewilson|10/05/2020|Best App for COVID-19|This app is a great help for COVID19 because it notifies you when you come in contact with someone with or has come in contact with someone else with coronavirus.|If we want to stop this we all need to download this app!!!!!|
bshaas|06/05/2020|Utterly useless|This app only records handshake data from physical interactions if the app is open in the foreground and on screen. If the app isn‚Äôt on screen or your phone screen is off it doesn‚Äôt work. Obviously nobody is going to leave the app open and on screen everywhere they go which renders it utterly useless and obsolete. Total waste of time and immoral to spread false hope like this is even a solution.|
WallyWoofWoof|30/04/2020|COVIDSafe|Will help us all get back to normal soon if all Australians download this App without worrying about battery life privacy issues|I found it has very little battery drain and certainly fell safer shopping|DOWNLOAD TODAY|
Annoyed as well|29/04/2020|The Lucky Country|How lucky are we to live in Australia And to have an App like this for the health and safety of all of us is amazing. We should all be grateful that we don‚Äôt live in the USA or anywhere else at the moment. üá¶üá∫ Thank you üôèüèº|
aff1993|27/04/2020|Clunky|The notifications about whether the app is active or not don‚Äôt seem to be consistent.|In the first hour turning off Bluetooth set off a notification advising that the app was not working but several hours later after toggling it it doesn‚Äôt do anything.|The inability to work in the background is just poor too.|
Assassin0387|26/04/2020|No Issues|Registered without any issues hope the country does the right thing and helps us beat this thing!|
expube|26/04/2020|Keeps on closing as idle|I installed this hoping to recommend it but currently this is not really useful as it closes after a bit of using Facebook gmail and twitter so it takes too much clicking to keep it alive. Also died while I was just listening to podcasts. If you can update it to the tracking API thingo that apparently can solve this.|
Agcousins34|26/04/2020|Working fine|I was able to register unlike the thousands that said it‚Äôs not working. Perhaps the issue is resolved now. Anyway here‚Äôs to the government tracking me as I sit on the couch|
AussieFan777|26/04/2020|Not a problem|Worked fine for me. Got setup in under a minute. No idea what the others are going on about but they must be doing something wrong.|
worked fine for me.|26/04/2020|Worked perfectly and only took seconds to set up!|No problem with registering my phone number. Was easy and simple to register.|

Ellis Ellis Ellis|18/05/2020|Stop the daily updates!|Developers take note: when users download your app updates the app is automatically closed. Unless people remember to open it it stays closed and is then useless. So please reduce the frequency of your tweaks.|
Big Crispin|08/05/2020|A wasted opportunity|What a tremendous idea. To have an app running quietly in the background on our phones. A silent sentinel guarding us against potential spread.|But it doesn‚Äôt work in the background on iPhones. The Government has still failed to take the correct advice and so the app is still failing to work.|Time and time again governments fail by not listening. Come on SloMo pull your finger out and get this sorted.|
trent123|04/05/2020|All fine. No issues|Totally fine and no issues with battery life or anything else. Might as well have another tool in the toolkit.|
LavenderJadeRose|04/05/2020|E|I installed the app and as soon as I entered I went into where I upload information or something and it said I have Covid-19. I never got tested I don‚Äôt think. I had a blood test 2 days ago but for something else. Did the blood test pick it up??|
Navidehs3155|29/04/2020|A question regarding how this app works|I have only one issues with thie covidsafe app.|So if you are driving in your car and behind the red light others have this app in their cars and you know Bluetooth on phones can pick each others even from different cars in 10 m distance.|If one of people in other cars gets possitive result Am I gonna get notifications to quarantine myself?|Especially gov claims that they don‚Äôt use your location so they don't know you were at a road!!!|
lkfitz|28/04/2020|Turn off wifi to verify mobile number|I couldn‚Äôt verify my mobile number until I was using mobile data. Others in my household also had the same issue until wifi was turned off on devices.|
Bonav3ntura|28/04/2020|Battery life|Over past 24 hours no noted issues with the battery levels if this app saves your life worth while downloading it|
accel12|27/04/2020|Very safe and privacy focused|Data is stored on your phone encrypted and can only be accessed by a health professional with your permission. Also it doesn‚Äôt record personal information.|
MACA2000|27/04/2020|Ruby Princess|Imagine if we‚Äôd all had this app when those people were allowed off the ship.|Or before it went through the nursing homes or the entire country.|
Charliejnrk|26/04/2020|Lets do this|Worked perfectly for me. Enter your mobile without the 0. Here‚Äôs hoping enough people use this so we can come out of the house and get back to normal life.|
Ffysjursd|26/04/2020|What about other phones in house|As far as I can work out you cannot enter other mobile numbers to ignore as we have three phones and when they are in charging station overnight they all will constantly be recording and storing useless information|
Matt-bot|26/04/2020|It working|Logged in and working. Let‚Äôs see what happens next. I have given more personal details to business around the world that I trust a lot less than the Australian government.|
JessicaQ|26/04/2020|No registration issues|I‚Äôve seen a lot of comments about being unable to register. The issue appears to be fixed.|
hibbi333|26/04/2020|Turn off wifi|Wouldn‚Äôt accept my number much like all the other reviews. I turned off Wifi and used the mobile network and it worked. If you‚Äôre having trouble registering too perhaps temporarily turn wifi off and try again.|
Barnsy125|26/04/2020|Works fine!|News outlets said to wait to 6pm to register. Predictably people ignored that advice and tried to register prematurely and then complained when it didn‚Äôt work. Go figure. Great initiative! Everyone get around it.|
Noooky|26/04/2020|Works fine.|You drongos just need to take the first 0 out of your number when you register.|Privacy policy says all data collected will be eliminated at the end of the pandemic.|
Bebingt|26/04/2020|Downloaded perfectly|Had no issues installing and verified with my mobile number perfectly.|
Stevie63748585959|26/04/2020|Seems easy enough|Asks for name postcode age bracket and mobile number. Less information the google and Facebook. Seems like only once you‚Äôve been informed you‚Äôve been near someone should it ask for more data..|
HP168|16/05/2020|Essential app|Can‚Äôt understand the fuss about this. People download most apps without a thought and they track you much more than this one can.|
jojomac12345|11/05/2020|Why daily reminders|I understand it needs Bluetooth to work. I don‚Äôt understand why I need to be reminded of this daily. Daily reminders are not needed twice a week would be great. It seems to work fine apart from that.|
Dezignz My Game|06/05/2020|Good idea but|Great idea|But the constant notifications/ reminder to leave Bluetooth on is abit annoying especially when my Bluetooth is always on|
bartholomew 2468|02/05/2020|Good theory bad in practice|Look it‚Äôs important I get that but the principal is fundamentally flawed unless you religiously carry your phone on your person which a lot of people don‚Äôt. Coupled with its ability to zap 50 percent of phone battery over night and zap the battery of other Bluetooth devices asking them who or what they are.|Constant Bluetooth handshakes if you want them or not|Flawed idea and poorly executed|
octapus.7|27/04/2020|Gets stuck verifying phone number|I support the app as I want to know if I‚Äôm exposed to covid-19 and I‚Äôd like others to know if I exposed them so we can stop its spread. It wouldn‚Äôt verify my phone number though and gets stuck on the get pin screen.|
MattJBrown|27/04/2020|Coming up with an error|When I try to enter my number it comes up with an error ‚ÄúError verifying phone number. Please check your details and try again.‚Äù|I‚Äôve triple checked my number and have tried about 5 times including closing app and reopening.|
ShhaMfna|27/04/2020|Bit glitchy|Relatively easy to set up however had errors verifying my number.. had to turn off wifi and also enter my mobile number without the zero|
jorrman|27/04/2020|Do it for your country!!|Install the app and use it. It‚Äôs the fastest way to get out of this crisis. Happy with the safeguards put in place by the Government to protect data and not use the information against us. Well done ScoMo/Hunty|
Clarke-Smith|27/04/2020|Dave|I‚Äôm not really in a position to rate the app but I have downloaded as I want to band together and get our lives back to something normal. Let‚Äôs look out for each other.|
bgt243%|26/04/2020|Great|Downloaded the app easily. I hope people that are having downloading issues remember to drop the zero at the start of their phone number.|
Krummo|26/04/2020|Chill out it wasn‚Äôt active until 6pm|Hearing lots of ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt work‚Äô but the announcement was it won‚Äôt be active until 6pm. Now active and seems to be accepting the phone number registration|
Alimajeed|26/04/2020|Phone number is fixed|Earlier while entering valid phone number and it was giving error. It‚Äôs now been fixed and working.|
Critta73|26/04/2020|Too easy|Very simple to install.|Make sure no full stops or anything when adding your name and it will then recognise phone number.|
MZareripoffs|26/04/2020|Easy Sign Up|Took less than a minute to sign up. Very user friendly. Not having the issue that some others have mentioned|
soylentmeme|26/04/2020|THIS WILL SAVE LIVES|If you seriously think this app will take more data to the government you have to be crazy. The fact you‚Äôre on a phone now looking at this review means they‚Äôre tracing you.|
Henrysdndjdhf|26/04/2020|Quick and simple set up|As an Australian we should all be doing all we can to flatten to curve and support contact tracing. I hope this app helps get us all back to our normal daily routine quicker. üá¶üá∫|
Dnzilla|26/04/2020|Follow the rules stay safe we we can all move on!|If we all get this right we can move past this lockdown save lives and be free again.|Don‚Äôt stuff it up for all of us. Please.|
Mattispantone81|26/04/2020|Simple enough|Straight forward activation. Privacy policy seems boiler plate. It‚Äôs not tracking my location and based on the information sites the legal security and privacy provisions seem solid.|
tpgd139|26/04/2020|Not able to register|Keep saying my phone number is invalid although everything is correct.|
CSafe Bsafe|13/05/2020|Let‚Äôs all do our bit|I feel really strongly that everyone should download this app. Such an easy way that we can contribute to easing social distancing restrictions and tracing positive cases. Simple setup too!|
Hermaayjr|03/05/2020|Only updated phones can download this app .... Poor elderly!|I downloaded the app but when it came to my husband.. The app did not download because his version of iOS was not enough!! Can you imagine how many elderly people cannot download this??? Stupid stupid stupid!!! Do you think app developers that this app only needs to keep YOU safe? Many elderly people carry old phones... Keep it simple so ALL can use it|
elDamo112|02/05/2020|Is it signed in?|I have signed up twice now? Every time I open it it‚Äôs asking me to register and sign up... when I do it says there is nothing else to do and the app is working .. then open it again to check it and it‚Äôs offering for me to sign up. Perhaps if that isn‚Äôt required and it is working then don‚Äôt prompt it - instead have a holding page saying the app is working|
mioannickname|02/05/2020|Updated to IOS 13.4.1 had to reinstall COVIDSafe|Updated my phone to IOS 13.4.1 (iPhone SE old). COVIDSafe displayed errors for Bluetooth settings which I couldn‚Äôt determine why ( all settings correct). Deleted and reinstalled the app. No longer getting errors.|
AurBnb host.|29/04/2020|If you cant verify Phone Number|Turn off WiFi and the app will verify.|It would have been nice if the app developers had advised of this problem.|App works well.|
Doomadgee01|29/04/2020|Thumbs up|For once it‚Äôs great to see all government agencies working together here to provide information across the board. There is information from the ATO Centrelink health people experiencing hardship etc etc|Good work!|
kipster42|29/04/2020|Doesn‚Äôt activate|Been trying for two days to activate but get continual error about being unable to verify phone number. No other detailsno support contact so have reluctantly had to give up|
Ando35|28/04/2020|Not letting me sign up|Unfortunately the app won‚Äôt let me sign up due to my phone number ‚Äòbeing incorrect‚Äô. I‚Äôve tried deleting and redownloading the app but it still shows up with the same message. I‚Äôve tried inputting my phone number as an 04... number as well as a 4... I‚Äôd be more than willing to download the app to save lives but unfortunately it‚Äôs not letting me download it properly :/|
Nickyb1003|28/04/2020|Perfect app ... If ?!?!|This app will save lives IF and only IF the government adds EVERYONE who tests (or has already tested) positive to it. Without this information it won‚Äôt work. Please make it law punishable by a large fine.|
A talking goanna|27/04/2020|Works great easy setup|Easy to set up the app only takes the information you give it which is name phone number postcode and age range. Download it so I can go to the pub!|
Madcap66|27/04/2020|Apple Watch please|Easy to download and simple to use but would like to have it linked to the Apple Watch. Don‚Äôt need to carry a phone most times as my watch can make and receive calls. It would make sense that when the watch is in range of your phone that it refreshes the new data just like your health apps do.|
logan coolum|27/04/2020|Great app|Very informative and inspirational. Gets somewhat political near the end and you get sick of hearing the blokes point of view when he keeps butting in and talking over the Coronavirus app. We‚Äôll done guys keep em coming!|
davidbrewster|27/04/2020|Working well. Easy setup|Like this idea and happy to help but wasn‚Äôt working. Stuck on splash screen. Half an hour later it was fine. A temporary glitch obviously|
Damnation182|27/04/2020|Easy|The app permissions deem this to be safe app despite giving data to the government. Whether it works or not is another matter but for the most part it‚Äôs well designed.|
bigbadmillow|27/04/2020|A little TOO easy to install|Took barely a minute to read the last few reviews followed them to a ‚ÄúT‚Äù and it worked like a charm|
Ddddddddggggggg|26/04/2020|Works just fine.|Seriously worried about the average IQ of some reviewers - works just fine...if you follow the instructions correctly and drop the ‚Äòzero‚Äô from your number üòê|
Take 0 out people|26/04/2020|Works Fine|People need to use their brains. App works fine. Don‚Äôt put the 0 in when entering your mobile number. It staggers me that people clearly have no clue. Well done Federal and State Govt for this app .|
foxbat_au|26/04/2020|Worked well so far!|No problems creating the account and verifying the phone number. If you are having an issue use +614... don‚Äôt put 04...|
Rosie5674|26/04/2020|Phone number verification|Installed the app and verified phone number but maybe it should be more clear for users to enter their phone number without the first 0 because it has the country number +61 in front so start with 4 to enter your mobile number.|
happy house of fox|26/04/2020|Less than a minute|Less than a minute to set up- set and forget is the best way.|Most of you negative review - you applied to early it up and running now|
PlatinumChris|26/04/2020|No problems|Just downloaded the app without any problems. Perhaps people who reported a problem didn‚Äôt follow the instructions closely which require you to turn your Bluetooth on BEFORE the last step.|
cherryblossomontop|26/04/2020|Quick|Was able to register in less than 3 minutes|
JuJu Galore|26/04/2020|No issues (yet)|Just downloaded and registered no issues (yet). Make sure you don‚Äôt include zero at start of your mobile number for verification.|
Fozzy2229|26/04/2020|Simple Registration|Must have fixed the early issues as I completed registration in a few minutes with each step clearly explained.|
new00113|26/04/2020|No problems|No issues with registering|Possibly all the problems others were having was a high demand issue|
Syllabub1969|26/04/2020|Registration only went live at 6pm|If you had problems registering earlier please try again. It is working now. Please share with friends and family.|
LightTHx|26/04/2020|Installed without any issues|Early teething problems experienced by early adopters seems to have been resolved now. Quick and easy sign up!|
angel_yonehara|26/04/2020|Easy to use!!|Works a treat. App must have had an update as I was easily able to verify my number. Very simple to use and had no confusions navigating through the sign up.|
Tygeray|26/04/2020|Works well|If people were not so impatient they would find that the logon works and the app will do as directed. As far a privacy goes most people give out more detail on social media|
Gadget Griffo|26/04/2020|Great idea...thanks|I‚Äôve worked in the tech industry for 20+ years and have no issue using this app...I figure it‚Äôll help get back to our usual way of life.|The phone verification step isn‚Äôt working though so can you please fix it.|Thanks.|
A_Laureti|03/05/2020|Please encourage two others to download|This is the kind of exponential growth we want. Encourage two others to download and ask them to do the same|
Hgosborne92|27/04/2020|Works as intended.|Privacy concerns aside and long term those will be exposed - both good and bad but fixed. I‚Äôm happily using this app. Would never normally install this but given the times it is needed.|
Donhesh|27/04/2020|Your privacy is protected Download it now..|Download the app ASAP. Don‚Äôt worry about your privacy you don‚Äôt have a privacy when you dead anyways. So don‚Äôt be an idiot. Just download the app and help to stop the spread.|
me_99999|26/04/2020|Does what they say|Easy to set up looking good so far hoping I‚Äôll never get an alert that I‚Äôve been near a covid case but at least if I do I‚Äôll be able to have a proactive reaction|
Dianna308|26/04/2020|Works great.|Those giving a one star clearly didn‚Äôt see that whilst the app was released today. You couldn‚Äôt register till after 6pm. Registered fine.|
EO1103|26/04/2020|Quick and easy|Think they must‚Äôve fixed the bugs as took me about 60 seconds to complete sign up|
Naomib1977|26/04/2020|Easy to navigate|Quick and easy to download. Had an error message on first try but came back 10 minutes later and it was fixed.|
Me_Y|26/04/2020|Reading the instructions helps|There was a clear instruction not to register your phone number til after 6pm so pretty much every review can be disregarded and it‚Äôs working fine.|
CBEECH01|26/04/2020|To get passed mobile verification|Make sure you are using mobile data disconnect any wifi connection. Let‚Äôs all do our part in returning to a normal life!|
Geoffstc|26/04/2020|Loaded no problem|I had no difficulty registering my phone number which many people are struggling with. I left the leading ‚Äú0‚Äù off when registering.|
Pomykev|26/04/2020|Registered within 60 seconds.|Expected difficulty in registering given the bad reviews. However is was really simple and I had no problems on my iPhone X|
Hudson's mummy|15/05/2020|Apple Watch|Hi there great App thank you! Can you please create an Apple Watch version so I can turn it on and not worry about whether I have my phone with me or not when I am out. Thank you üôè|
Shutts13|01/05/2020|Paul Shuttleworth|After researching privacy protection and against my very strong distrust of big government monitoring systems I decided to download the app. The installation was very easy n quick. Hopefully my decision was a correct one.|
cogunn|29/04/2020|Daily alerts|I willingly downloaded the app I‚Äôve kept it running in the background and I have Bluetooth on. Please stop sending me alerts every day asking for my help when that‚Äôs exactly what I‚Äôm doing.|The quickest way to make me delete the app is to keep these daily alerts. Give me the option to turn them off!|
Rusty RustyNails|29/04/2020|Why no phone or contact email address to report problems or get advice installation etc|I am trying my best to get people on board to install this App but for the life of me I cannot see anyway to ring an expert etc|
Jon Tirsen|28/04/2020|Works well now|It had some issues when it launched but it works fine now.|It‚Äôs not perfect but it‚Äôs what we got. Let‚Äôs try to make this work.|

Ladybeetle80|28/04/2020|Registering issues. Turn wifi off.|I kept getting an error that my information couldn‚Äôt be verified. I tried about 10 times. Then I turned my wi-fi off and it registered straight away.|
Nisus|27/04/2020|Cannot register - unable to validate number|I know that a lot people have successfully gotten this app to register however both my wife and I do not receive any sms pin. She is using Telstra and I am on Vodafone. We do not use the zero in our mobile numbers. I‚Äôve uninstalled and reinstalled rebooted the iPhones etc. no luck. I also cannot seem to find a support number or email.|
G.Coops|27/04/2020|Notification error|Continual notification about Bluetooth possible not on as the app is not pinging any other bluetooth device cause I‚Äôm keeping my social distance. If it keeps happening I will delete. And why release before safe guard legislation is in place that was a dumb mistake|
Rod314159|27/04/2020|Show stored data?|Thanks for the app... It would be nice to see some form of activity on the app once it is running both as interest/encouragement and as a way too show that it is working. Maybe some form of chart?|
richie-a|26/04/2020|Straight forward|Straight forward install clear instructions. No issues entering mobile number or verifying account.|
dy222|26/04/2020|Easy setup|Very quick and painless setup informative too. Didn‚Äôt experience any of the number registration issues everyone spoke of here - they may have fixed it? 9:00pm 26/4|
Beonnybeef|26/04/2020|Unclear instructions...|Registered mobile fine (without leading 0).|Says leave the app running - unclear whether this means with phone on screen off or running in background. Video instructions would be sensible!|
Penrith Peter|26/04/2020|So far so good|All the bad reviews didn‚Äôt read the information that you couldn‚Äôt register until after 6pm. If you waited there was no problem. Anyway good on them for trying to get in early|

Leesh Peesh|26/04/2020|Very easy|Simple to use. Doesn‚Äôt ask for much information - plenty of apps and sites would have more on me than this does!|Do it people|
Bella Huo|26/04/2020|Already activated!|There is no problem connecting to the mobile phone number(IPhone users with 0)|
You have 1 notification|26/04/2020|Do it for your loved ones.|Downloaded app at 8:30pm 26/04.|No dramas at all took 3 mins total.|My understanding (could be wrong) is the app was available but registration wasn‚Äôt till after 6pm.|Best wishes to stay safe!|
j-b1256|26/04/2020|Simple and easy|To all those people having difficulties in entering your mobile number it only wants a nine digit number so drop the zero at the beginning|
Musofreak|26/04/2020|Works fine|Had no problem activating with my phone number. Make sure you omit the 0 at the start of the number.|
KingMattyBoomBah|26/04/2020|10 second installation no issues|Not sure what the problem with the phone number was? Surely the ‚Äò+61‚Äô part wasn‚Äôt confusing people? Just drop the first digit idjits!|
troydboy|26/04/2020|Can‚Äôt verify number???|The reason for this was the app was available to download but you couldn‚Äôt actually register until 6pm on Sunday night!!|

oldfolky2|18/05/2020|Only on the Australian App Store|For a multicultural country with immigrants from all over the world it is exceedingly bone headed to have this app restricted to the Australian App Store. My wife and I have lived here for 7 years and still have US apple IDs so it took a lot of messing around to download this.|Thing of the number of international student wants temporary migrants and people born overseas who need this app to be as simple to download as possible.|
rybornacnud|05/05/2020|Save not just your own & family or friends lives|I have got a lot of people to come in to close contact with the virustot|

Gazmol|26/04/2020|Works fine|No problems with phone registration. Just be sure to enter the number WITHOUT the initial ‚Äú0‚Äù. You‚Äôll see +61....... and just need to enter your number starting with the first 4. Go Australia!|

CanAussieMatt|26/04/2020|Phone number could not be confirmed|When I set up the app it would not send an SMS to my registered number. Is this because it hasn‚Äôt become operational yet?|
f2008|21/05/2020|Hurry up government!!|Apple just released 13.5 to the public this morning to the world and it has its own integrated COVID-19 so it can work with our Aussie app. Hurry up and released an Update. Thank you!!|

drgreg75|26/04/2020|Could not pass past verify phone number|The app would not pass the ‚Äò verify phone number screen ‚Äò. I changed my name to take out a number that was in there... I was supposed to be able to be anonymous. Then it seemed to work.|The explanations of leave this on do this don‚Äôt close that are very ‚Äòtechnical‚Äô and not written for someone over say 50 with limited understanding of some of the terminology used.|There should be a simple test to tell me that I am using it correctly.|AlsoI should be able to see people around me who have the app activated. This would help me suggest uptake to those who I can see may not understand.|
tomlikesbeetroot|26/04/2020|Working fine|Registration worked fine for me less than 30 second process.|

Lizabella|26/04/2020|Great!|Let‚Äôs hope plenty people realise that they just aren‚Äôt that interesting for the government to track their every movement and get behind the app. Good on the Aussie government for using innovative solutions to track this disease.|
Toddman80|26/04/2020|Downloaded and installed|Since I downloaded and installed this app I still haven‚Äôt caught COVID-19 so it must be working ü§£. Seriously - happy to download it if it means Australia gets out of lockdown sooner and helps saves lives.|
Buddy for PM|26/04/2020|Help your family and front line health workers|This will certainly make it much quicker for public health to help crush COVID-19 when a case is detected. The more than download it the more it will protect us all.|
congoblue|26/04/2020|Great idea needs our support|Great idea but it needs everyone‚Äôs support to work.|No privacy concerns why would the government want to track my phone for any other purpose?|
James_129|26/04/2020|Not yet active|Foolish to launch this when people can‚Äôt actually register yet. Having looked about online the ‚Äòinvalid phone number‚Äô issue is occurring for everyone and ‚Äòthe back end services may only be properly switched on at 6pm.‚Äô Well... here‚Äôs hoping!|
Rifat Nabi|26/04/2020|Error verifying phone number|Getting error verifying phone number even after giving a valid number. Tried with both 04 and 4.|
Alicesharlene|02/05/2020|Not deaf friendly|In the info it says if you‚Äôve been near someone who has been in contact with coronavirus you will get a call.|That shows a big lack of ensuring all of us are put into consideration.|Not just those who are deaf but also those who are unable to communicate verbally.|Please consider an alternative option for those like myself.|
Stevekeen123|27/04/2020|Invalid phone number|After getting frustrated being told phone number is invalid......I turned off WIFI and hey presto....everything worked:)|
Dan N..|27/04/2020|COVIDSafe app|This app is amazing. I would strongly recommend all Australians download it. Set up is easy and does not eat into battery. Anyone of any age can download and use it. Younger children will need a parent's consent.|
Danico1983|27/04/2020|Do your part|Might not be perfect but more downloads will lead to faster easing of lockdowns.|Any social media app had more on you than this app every will. The privacy argument is null.|
Pommiewise|27/04/2020|Easy to install on iPhone 6|Why wouldn‚Äôt you download something that gives you peace of mind and protects yourself and others?|
Peacokle|27/04/2020|Quick easy and secure|Super quick and easy to get going. Only took a minute. Hope everyone else gets it as well.|
rigsales|27/04/2020|Very easy setup|I have had no issues with installing this app and registering took 20 seconds.|There has been no impact on the phone battery life.|
Aj56788|27/04/2020|DOES NOT TRACK YOUR LOCATION|Great app works well it does not track your location.. it tracks the people who have been in contact with you in the last 21 days.|
danababy1984|26/04/2020|Easy set up|Was set up in seconds. No more data then what we give Facebook etc so don‚Äôt see a problem in using it|
Proofreader|26/04/2020|I‚Äôll wait for Apple/Google API|Contact tracing is incredibly important but in its current form this app is likely to be highly ineffective because of the privacy features of iOS|It sounds like it can only work if you don‚Äôt use any other app. Imagine visiting Woolworths and remembering to launch the app as you enter and not to launch any other app until you leave.|In relation to privacy using the proper API will render the collection of every users name and number completely unnecessary.|I do like that it‚Äôs compatible with iOS 10 meaning it works with iPhones from 2012 and later. I hope this compatibly continues once the government acknowledge and embrace the API|
Bhumil Soni|26/04/2020|Great Initiative|I was able to register it without any problem. If installed by EVERYONE then this is a really good initiative and can be very much helpful in keeping us safe and aware about anyone covid-19 positive nearby .|
1bigfellafd|26/04/2020|Registration|No problem with registrationall completed within a few minutes.|
mjhoops|26/04/2020|Quick and easy|Signed up in 60 seconds. No problem verifying my mobile phone number|
DamoCarso|26/04/2020|Working|Others have said it won‚Äôt go past the mobile number verify screen.. it‚Äôs all working now.|
huurdy|26/04/2020|This could save my life.|I‚Äôm happily using this app so I can know if I come into contact with a COVID-19 positive person. Hopefully enough others will use this app and we can relax our restrictions sooner.|
ttmelbz|26/04/2020|Stay safe|Good app to stop the spread of coronavirus doesn‚Äôt give the government your pornhub search history so don‚Äôt worry about your local member of parliament knowing about your search for muppet bukake party.|
qwaqa101|26/04/2020|App error|It says there is an error verifying my phone number yet all my details are correct. I have attempted to set up multiple times with no success.|
GrannyJCforKL|19/05/2020|Drains battery on iPhone ......|Downloaded the app open it when I‚Äôm out plying golf drains the battery over 18 holes. Do I assume contact tracing can happen by tracking back through bookings and only use it when I‚Äôm in a situation where contact tracing is more difficult?|
george.osborne92|08/05/2020|Persistent login issue|Hey guys. Not sure if this a one off user problem or not but I‚Äôm having to re validate myself every morning when I open the app from the push notification.|
mirsyf|02/05/2020|Does not work properly on my iPhone|Every now and then when I open and use the app on my iPhone Xs which runs 13.3.1 the black screen appears showing grey letters of ‚ÄúCOVIDSafe‚Äù. The screen would either stuck there forever or fades back to normal interface and then shows black again. Newest version of the app no storage problems. Someone get it fixed pls!|
buthurapi|28/04/2020|Apple Watch integration?|It would be so much more effective if it worked on Apple Watch. I don‚Äôt always have my phone with me when I‚Äôm out usually because I forget it but always wear my watch.|
Perinatal 72|28/04/2020|Great ideaused all my battery in 6 hours at work|As a supermarket worker I thought this is a great ideastick phone in my pocket on silent and leave it downloaded and set it up with no problemswent to work and it used all my battery :(|I have Had iPhones for a long time and have NEVER EVER had my phone go flat.

Adolf999|27/04/2020|Great app|This is a great way to use your blue tooth signal to tag other users for 21 days in the event there is an infection everyone can be notified and get a test. Together as a country Australia can beat this|
claudecat1|27/04/2020|Twinkles|Have loaded app on both my phone and my husband‚Äôs. Phone number accepted on my phone but not my husband‚Äôs with the error message that his number is unable to be verified. 0 or no 0 at the beginning of the number does not make a difference.|
Mell_ss|27/04/2020|Doing it for the health care workers!|Downloaded app.|I would like to know if I have been close to anyone with virus to keep myself and family safe.|Thank you|
WCSutto|27/04/2020|Buggy but important.|Couldn‚Äôt get my verification PIN until I disconnected from my home wifi. Try this if you‚Äôre having trouble.|
The real ballchin|27/04/2020|Not paranoid|It doesn‚Äôt track you just bounces your Bluetooth.|Plus the gov really couldn‚Äôt care less about tracking you Karen. So just instal the app. It‚Äôs 30 seconds.|
Julio_Mel|27/04/2020|Cannot update information|Had no issue with registration done in 30 seconds.|However tested the tap of updating information it required a pin from text message to proceed tried several times never received a text then the app got frozen|This needs to be fixed ASAP|
Nesstacular|26/04/2020|Simple and quick registration|Very simple registration process took no time at all. Did not experience any of the issues noted in other reviews.|
Agamingratfan66|26/04/2020|Up and at ‚Äôem!|On the first try the app froze most likely due to the high volume of people trying to activate it but second time it worked like a charm!|
ChloeTheLaw|26/04/2020|sign up issues fixed!|Able to register fine now. Thank you!|
G00D D00D|26/04/2020|Help keep us all safe and get us back to normal quickly.|Hopefully it helps us all stay safe. Strong privacy protection. Everyone should install it ASAP.|
melj217$|26/04/2020|All good|Took only half a minute to set up no problems despite reviews earlier saying that had problems (I‚Äôm using an old iPhone)|
BeanyBear77|26/04/2020|Worked first time no problems|I just hope everyone else uses it too so we can get back to normal faster.|
Richmond Vic|26/04/2020|Easy|Took 20 seconds to register. You can‚Äôt say that about most apps. People need to take a reality check on privacy concerns - particularly if they are on social media.|
lbittneswuthlegs|26/04/2020|Worked fine and was quick|Quick and easy|
MLIGC|26/04/2020|COVIDSafe|Eventually got into through the phone number section and now all good. Takes a little time to verify phone number but only first few hours of being available. MLIGC|
Clive_dale|26/04/2020|Simple step to keeping safe|Loading this was easy. Hoping many do the same to improve my prospects of staying safe.|
Male sine|26/04/2020|Simple and Easy to Set Up|Works well - took me less than a minute to register. Finally some technology that can make a difference!|
smicko77|26/04/2020|Easy to setup|Easy app to use. Setup simple. Hard to find the app though. The Australian government needs to advertise the app more so more people use it otherwise it‚Äôs pointless|
RhinoInAdelaide|26/04/2020|Just download it|Important for EVERYONE to download and use this app. You may not be sick but you might be in contact with someone. Wouldn‚Äôt you like to me the community safe?|
Ashhhhhh23|26/04/2020|Unable to register|Unable to put in my phone number to receive PIN. Deleted and redownloaded several times.|
Begaras|11/05/2020|I get why we need it but hasn‚Äôt been done well|The constant notifications are making me want to delete the app. It‚Äôs open. It‚Äôs running in the background. No I cannot leave my phone unlocked 24-7. If those are the requirements for it to work you need to build a better app.|
NoFreeNicknames1009|11/05/2020|It‚Äôs ok I think|It would be helpful if users can set their own time to remind us to use the app. Some of us start our day at 6 or 7 am so a reminder at 9 am is a few hours too late.|
joeStealth|29/04/2020|Stop the paranoia.|Just download it and stop being paranoid.|The sooner we do everything asked of us the sooner we can get back to normality.|
kab83|27/04/2020|Phone number error|Very frustrating to have an issue entering my phone number. I did not add the zero at the beginning (just went straight to 4......) and still had an issue. I updated my phone removed and reinstalled the app and still had the issue. Really annoying.|
SydneyMan_zzzz|27/04/2020|Please clarify if the app needs to open on the screen?|Does the app have to be opened on the screen all the time for it to work? Or can it just be running in the background?|
Kanfruns|27/04/2020|Thank you|To everyone who has downloaded this App.|Thank you so much for being a responsible Australian citizen and caring about our nation‚Äôs health.|You will make a difference!|
floridiculous|27/04/2020|Mobile number?|Not sure what the app needs my mobile number for so I stopped at step 2 of the sign up form.|If I need to be notified the app can just send a push notification. I don‚Äôt understand why it needs any personal information instead.|Waiting for a version that‚Äôs based on Apple‚Äôs/Google‚Äôs privacy-focused exposure notification system.|
Ash Tiwari|27/04/2020|Do your bit|Cmon if you worried about your privacy first delete your Facebook and then stop using your gmail. Ohh wait even this wont work they already profiled you... . JUST DOWNLOAD THE APP|
jkat9|27/04/2020|Battery drain|Great idea but in less than hour my iPhone XS battery has drained 44% with no other use. Makes having the app and leaving Bluetooth on unfeasible. Need to remember to turn it on when likely you come in contact making its efficacy questionable.|
Ross138|27/04/2020|No battery problem - iPhone 6|Left it running in background overnight on my iPhone 6 without charging. 82% at 11pm 67% at 7am.|I can‚Äôt see any difference to power consumption.|
Mattchewtee|27/04/2020|Worked fine|Worked fine fast download and easy sign up. Let‚Äôs all do our park to help stop the spread. Paranoid conspiracy theorists are the enemy of the rest of society.|
Bemused and bewildered|26/04/2020|No problems|Registered entered phone number and received PIN. It works fine if you don‚Äôt try and do it before it goes live.|
yes_matron|26/04/2020|The mobile error seems to have been fixed|Working effectively now as I just signed up.|
Snooze1018|26/04/2020|2 minutes|Took me less than 2 minutes to download and register.|
Mani8487|26/04/2020|Easy setup|I'm glad the government finally made this app very easy to install and use. we can beat this coronavirus if we can work together.|
BeentoBerlin|26/04/2020|Registration worked fine|A lot has changed in four hours it seems. Registration worked fine and it is set up. Straightforward and hoping I never get an alert!|
Bob9242|26/04/2020|Working Now|It‚Äôs a pity the Government didn‚Äôt make a release saying the app wouldn‚Äôt work before 6.00 pm.|However it‚Äôs working now and the good thing is that a lot of people are trying to use it. Hopefully it will get a large take up and assist us in getting back to normal|Boba|
Peter_W 1946|26/04/2020|No problem with installation|To those who had installation problems: perhaps you needed to include the leading zero on your mobile phone number ie: 0421 etc.|Just supposin...|
StevieTK|26/04/2020|Registration was surprisingly very quick|Phone number worked fine for me. Left out the leading zero if that helps|
anmaca78|26/04/2020|Need to drop the 0 before entering number|Hi all|You you need drop the 0 from tour mobile numbers. As it is set up as international standard. 61 for Australia. Then drop the 0 and start with your 4|
Guitarnish|26/04/2020|Thank you!|Glad we have followed suit from some other countries and developed this app. Should help greatly with contact tracing. Let‚Äôs hope this works well!|
911-996|26/04/2020|The is not ready yet|Looks like the app was released prematurely. Trying to complete the registration within the app and after entering the phone number to get the pin I keep getting the messages ‚ÄúError verifying phone number‚Äù. Why release an app when it‚Äôs not fully functional. This will only put people off.|
Mhano|21/05/2020|Good start - please update with Apple and google|The app and legislated protections to our privacy are a great start. Please update with the Covid-19 Exposure Notification APIs from Apple and Google to improve effectiveness and privacy.|
everyonrwantstobelikeMikey|08/05/2020|An APP all Aussie‚Äôs definitely should have on their phone|So simple download register leave running. A great to to help the nation through this crazy time.|
jpixie88|08/05/2020|Have to re-enter details daily|Downloaded the app and set it up easily and seemed very simple to use however noticed that every time I open it I have to re-register. Does it work if not registered? As I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not going to remember to do this every time I leave the house and therefore makes it ineffective|
Jesus666|29/04/2020|Hey idiots stop with the useless notifications|I enabled notifications so I could be notified in case I have C19 but notifications pop up to tell me to turn Bluetooth on and it‚Äôs already on|So I‚Äôm turning off notifications I might as well delete the app|- let me give you a heads up people DONT want useless notifications on their phones popping up interrupting !!|Knock it off bozos !|
wrfdth|28/04/2020|Buggy|This app won‚Äôt install properly. The splash screen keeps popping up during the registration process and then the process stalls when trying to get the PIN. I entered the phone number without the leading 0 no improvement. I‚Äôve reinstalled restarted and waited all with no effect. For me this app is currently unusable. And yes I‚Äôm using a current phone with an up to date OS...|
CelinaBieber56|27/04/2020|Cant register my mobile number|For some reason I‚Äôve tried to enter my number and even tried a family member‚Äôs phone number i still couldn‚Äôt get the pin. Also know someone with the same issue|
Louc5775|27/04/2020|Doing my bit|Would like to get the bans and restrictions lifted sooner. Would like to see more Australians downloading the app. My recommendation is that comms from telco to download the app might boost numbers.|
sholtom|27/04/2020|Works fine|Had some issues yesterday but all fixed now|
foxj23|27/04/2020|Working well|There was an initial problem with verifying my mobile that has now been fixed.|
Graeme 963563|26/04/2020|Let‚Äôs get on board|Installed this without any problems|Registration easy and successful|This is the next step in making Australia a safer place and helping lift restrictions|Just do it|
8765hhw|26/04/2020|Easy to register|Most negative reviews are by folks who tried to register before the 6pm start time and wondered why the registration process didn‚Äôt work. Duh|
Covid-go-away|26/04/2020|Keeping Us Safe|Brilliant easy to install.|Glad to do my bit to keep others and myself safe.|The registration process was perfect after 6pm as announced.|
Fokc|26/04/2020|Looks fine to me|Seen all the comments about unable to verify but no issue here.|Looks simple enough.|If it helps it‚Äôs worth doing!|
chickenpalmer|26/04/2020|Easy|Installed quick and easily. Records minimal information. You give more personal information completing a tax return.|Happy to get on board to help stop the spread of COVID and get back to normal|
Tim Skylovski|26/04/2020|Phone number issue|Phone number was not registering but then I realised that was because you couldn‚Äôt sign up till 6pm AEST. Was fine after|
Jackthepizzamuncher|26/04/2020|Wonderful app|You‚Äôve probably spent half your life on Facebook being data mined - stop worrying about nonexistent privacy issues and download it.|
#seemslegit#itislegit|26/04/2020|5 stars|Works perfectly and only a small app. If you are unsure about it- think of the health workers that you might just save by downloading this...|
Scott Marsh Qld|26/04/2020|COVIDSafe app Mobile number not registering|For those who are saying it‚Äôs not working the problem is you. Enter your mobile number with the leading zero left off. The +61 takes the place of the first digit of your phone number. Basic stuff people..|
Aaronjc78|26/04/2020|Easy to install|No problems installing. Remember to drop the first zero from your mobile number when verifying the pin came through in < 1 second|
Aldo Mazzoni|26/04/2020|Well Done. We Need This|Easy registration and setup. I checked this app out and it is secure. The government only gets access to the data if we ever get infected and volunteer the data.|
JVPalace|26/04/2020|Let's work together to defend Australia|It is simple and easy to install and register. I spent less than 5 mins to make it done and now it works for me well.|
Covert182|26/04/2020|Working for me|Read the previous reviews with registration issues. No problems for me. Was quick and simple.|
Stager1|26/04/2020|Signed up no problem.|Signed up to the app after 6.00pm on day of release and everything worked fine. All registered ok.|
nickswebtsv|26/04/2020|Be Safe|Quick to install. Privacy policy is clear to read through. A very simple app that does only appear to have one purpose.|
Dixonat|26/04/2020|Keeping us healthy.|This is a great idea to stop the spread. If someone who‚Äôs positive comes into contact with me - this makes it easy for me to find out. I want to know this info.|
Bob Sunkle|26/04/2020|Not recognising phone number|I realise it‚Äôs early in the release of this app but the fundamentals aren‚Äôt even working. I can‚Äôt sign up because it doesn‚Äôt recognise my phone number. Many people who are willing to use this app will be discouraged by this fail straight up.|
ajaxspray|26/04/2020|Phone number verification|Phone number verification doesn‚Äôt work. Keeps coming up with an error message|
Samchae|26/04/2020|Won‚Äôt let me register|So I got all the notifications to say the app had been released and to download it. Downloaded it and second step of registration and it WONT verify my mobile number hahaha. Great app. Doesn‚Äôt even work first go!??? Ps: I tried with my full 10 digit number and without the ‚Äò0‚Äô at the beginning and neither worked!! Will you notify us when this is fixed?|
Baoilan|08/05/2020|Switched off Bluetooth when in isolation|When I‚Äôm in isolation like at home I switched off my Bluetooth to save data and only switched it on when I am out and about. Hopefully this COVIDSafe app developers should respect that and stop sending me text.|
NewOptusHater|06/05/2020|Needs a symbol that it is active & running|Download and activity should be mandatory until a vaccine is available.|Needs a symbol that it is active (nothing fancy that wastes battery) but just a pulsating button (red??) that show Bluetooth is on and app is running|
s_mcleod|01/05/2020|Doesn‚Äôt run in the background properly|Pretty sure it needs to be running in the foreground or at least reopened frequently to work really annoying pop ups would be better if it used the Apple API|
oldgrumpyguy|28/04/2020|Works great|Haven‚Äôt noticed any problems or battery drain. The whole family‚Äôs got it. Anything we can do to on top of COVID we‚Äôre in!|
CaroReviewer|27/04/2020|Turn off wifi to register|If you are getting an error message not verifying your phone no switch off WiFi and try it again.|Very important initiative!|
Daynzey|27/04/2020|Difficult|I saw this app and thought that getting it would be a good idea but when I tried to sign in but I couldn‚Äôt it said there was something wrong with my phone number and I know there is nothing wrong with it|
himyff|27/04/2020|Fix frozen screen|Turn off all over apps and try a couple times|

Joshuah006|26/04/2020|Easy to use|Easy to install and setup. Mobile phone number issue has not been activated so it works well!|

Jeybsb|26/04/2020|Easy to register|Some reviews mentioned problems with registration but I am using ios and I didn‚Äôt have any problems.|
Livio regano|26/04/2020|Easy to use.|When downloading do not put a zero infront of your mobile number. It won‚Äôt add your number if you put it as +6104... must just be +614...|
LiabilityAUS|26/04/2020|Only leaving a review because|People leaving 1* when they were told don‚Äôt register until after 6pm ü§£ü§£ü§£|
DaveT1357|26/04/2020|David|Worked perfectly. Not sure why everyone is having so much trouble verifying number. I had no issue at all|
Esther Getting fit|26/04/2020|Adapting to the times|I think it‚Äôs great the government is adapting to the times and using technology to help us contain and control this outbreak. Thank you for making this possible.|
roboh1|26/04/2020|Verifying mobile number fails|Can not complete the registration process on this release. Unable to verify mobile number.|
Luca Staley|26/04/2020|Error sending pin|There is an error sending the pin after entering mobile phone number so I can not use the app.|
Buzzbuzz05|03/05/2020|Stupid notifications|When installing the app. It asks you to turn on notifications so they can warn you if you come in contact with some with COVID19. But what they don‚Äôt tell you is that they will continually send you notifications to ‚Äústay home and stay safe‚Äù.|I want the app. I just don‚Äôt constantly want my phone going off with stupid notifications.|
Bdapples|27/04/2020|Can‚Äôt even log in?|I get to the part where I put in my phone number and it comes up with an error after about 4 minutes saying it cannot verify my phone number? I‚Äôve tried the number without the 0 with the +61 and it still won‚Äôt work after trying 3 different ways 3 times I gave up! Frustrating!|
RachelofUltimo|27/04/2020|Why to down load|Do it now. Delete it next year. Let‚Äôs get Covid out of our population so we can go back to normal. Yes it is invasive. But it is necessary for now.|
Rezo K|27/04/2020|Remove the zero for your phone number!|Otherwise works fine.|
figjamgle|26/04/2020|Just fine|No phone number issue|Are your phones up to date?|
Sophie-93|26/04/2020|No issues|Signed up within minutes no issues at all.|
Marshase|26/04/2020|Works perfectly|Easy to install - seems everybody giving one star doesn‚Äôt know that +61 is followed by 4... so leave out the zero.|
Brozy007|26/04/2020|Will be confusing with DTAs Coronavirus Australia App|Suggest collaborating with DTA to integrate both apps functionality or retiring the DTA app so only this app is downloaded.|There is the chance that users will download the DYA Coronavirus App thinking it is the COVIDsafe tracking app!|
ChoonHunter|26/04/2020|It‚Äôs good|I think it‚Äôs good. They don‚Äôt request location services so they aren‚Äôt tracking your location to anyone who thinks the government is watching.|
malos.nagrand|26/04/2020|Worked perfectly|Installed and registered without a hitch. Verified phone number no problems on both my iPhones.|
S. M. A. Zaidi|26/04/2020|Good Work üëç|Quick n easy to setup within a minute and quickly verified my number as well. Hope it will be effective too. Nice work Gov üëç|

John Noble|06/05/2020|It‚Äôs running ‚Äì stop nagging me|What‚Äôs the notification for? The app is running. Bluetooth is on. If you keep sending me pointless notifications I‚Äôll just turn them off and now the whole point of the app is defeated.|Leave me alone unless you have something critically important to tell me.|Update: v1.1 still does this!

Blakus 26|01/05/2020|Not available in other App Store regions?|My partner is from Canada but cannot download the app. I'm sure there are thousands of other people in the same boat. Any way of making it available to all App Store regions?|

Shahab qamar|27/04/2020|Screen goes black every few seconds|Like others have mentioned the screen goes dark with text ‚ÄúCOVIDSafe‚Äù.

martchat|18/05/2020|Question|Does it really work in the background. If not then it is of little use as we have other app in use in the foreground like Runkeeper email etc?|
JP7577|07/05/2020|Could not register mobile number|I am always prompted with an Error verifying phone number. As the +61 is already provided I only put my 9-digit phone number without the leading zero but it keeps popping the error. Also tried putting the leading 0 but still the same error.|
Anarkii|05/05/2020|Doesn‚Äôt even work|The app itself doesn‚Äôt even work as advertised. It only works if the iPhone is unlocked and the app is running in the foreground. If that isn‚Äôt happening then the app is 100% useless. There is proof of this all over Twitter. (@tomwarren being one account). See for yourselves.|
Quietisbetter|05/05/2020|Annoying notifications|The app runs fine but I‚Äôm notified daily to keep Bluetooth on and the app running. It is SO annoying. If I get one more I‚Äôm deleting it. No one enjoys being nagged by their phone.|

woftam72|28/04/2020|Won‚Äôt accept phone number|Tried about 30 times to register. Tried without the 0 at the front of the number and with it. Deleted the app restarted the phone and tried again. No support number. Obviously testing was not a priority. Just wasted hours of my time.|

philipw58|27/04/2020|Mobile number error|App won‚Äôt accept my mobile number have tried leaving off the first 0 like others have suggested in the reviews. My wife is also having the same issue! Therefore app is useless as you cannot proceed without a mobile number!|
Dylan4776435|27/04/2020|Great App|Wonderful initiative by the Australian government to help slow down the spread of the virus. Will definitely save lives and allow for restrictions to be eased sooner!|
garrytaulu|27/04/2020|Pointless unless running in the foreground|This app requires your screen to be unlocked and the app running to even work which means reduced privacy and battery life and an inconvenience if you need to use other apps. It‚Äôd be much better to use the Exposure Notification API from Apple than rushing this out.|
Old Dobby|26/04/2020|Easypeasy|Done in a minute drop the 0 from your mobile number.|

Bombedybombombom om|08/05/2020|I like the idea but|It chewed up 70% of phone battery in 4 hours.... The point is that it‚Äôs on all the time but how can you do that when your phone is dead? 70% usually lasts me about 10-12 hours.|It‚Äôs just not feasible or reasonable for me to keep it running|

rabidsumo|26/04/2020|Stay Home Stay Safe|While I appreciate the government trying to get an App out as quickly as possible it pays to quality test before hand and have the server side infrastructure to support the influx of users. App continually crashes and error message for certifying number is not indicative of the error at hand.|
PrimaryTeachQld|09/05/2020|Annoying|Happy to sign up and hope the app helps in the long term. But the non ‚Äúnotifications‚Äù are annoying. If there is nothing to notify why does it keep sending them? This could be counter productive to people‚Äôs cooperation.|
Gryfsrtgffhb|30/04/2020|Seems ok|Why do I need a notification every day to tell me to keep it on. I have now turned off notifications so hopefully it still works. I do shift work so a reminder at 9am is a fail.|

I can‚Äôt hear a sound while casting YouTube to a Google Home nor listen to music from my Aeropex bluetooth hesdphone.|
Da Blokes|20/05/2020|Why you need my phone number?|could you not keep it all anonymous?|Everyone gets a unique identifier and the app keeps 20 days of contact with other identifiers. Then when someone gets a positive result they also get given an access code that only works once so prankers can‚Äôt pretend they have it to scare others. You punch that code in and if it comes up yes the alert goes out to your buddy phones.|Maybe to get people to admit they have it and get more ppl to download the app you don‚Äôt even tell them the result but their code gives them the result.|Just spit balling. Gov stuffed up with mygov and census. So I‚Äôm hesitantly caving.|
samjarrett|18/05/2020|Cheap copy?|The app sends a daily push notification mentioning putting the app into an internal ‚Äúpower saving mode‚Äù which isn‚Äôt present on the Australian version of this app. Did no one review the code they cloned from Singapore?|
iiNetter|17/05/2020|An unfortunate necessity|In addition to my previous reviews below I understand that Apple don‚Äôt approve apps that utilise undocumented/private APIs but I would have thought that given the current circumstances they would be willing to make exceptions so apps like this can better integrate with the security features of iOS. This would be particularly important for devices that won‚Äôt receive iOS 13.4.5/13.5 and therefore won‚Äôt receive the Exposure Notification API feature that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google in response to the pandemic.|Update to my previous review: I‚Äôve just discovered that the tick boxes I referred to are still there but you now have to scroll down from the green image it simply wasn‚Äôt obvious there was more below this screen until I accidentally scrolled upwards while the image was displayed. Perhaps the fact there is more below the image could be made more obvious with a downward facing arrow particularly when the app is unable to function or better yet the part of the screen containing the tick/crosses is brought up over the green image when the app is unable to function.|In addition to my previous review below I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had. The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e.g. permissions Bluetooth disabled etc. with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled. Also the updated version of the app displays a green image which is a universally understood indication that something is working even if the app is unable to function at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if/when the app is unable to function.|Previous review:|Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if/when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number? This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal.|
Peter 1359|17/05/2020|Keeps nagging pointlessly.|Every single day the app tells me to register even though I already have done so correctly as well as telling me to have my Bluetooth on ‚Äî it is on all the time I dislike being told to do things I already have done. If I want pointless nagging about things - I would get back with my ex! I do not watch / listen to annoying ads on the tv / radio (I change stations or watch a DVD.).|There is no where on the app to send feedback about this annoyance. I am sure that if I sent e-mails daily to the Prime Minister berating him he would have police (& possibly ASIO) on my doorstep telling my to cease. Well...This constant berating to do turn the Bluetooth on to register to have the app has now resulted in me ceasing this app. I am deleting it from my iPad and iPhone. I would rather spend an extra six months in lock down than put up with another day of reminders.|

raiden337|01/05/2020|Seriously held back by iOS|As reported by News.com.au and within the app itself the app must be open with your screen turned on to track Contacts.|I can‚Äôt leave my phone unlocked whilst I‚Äôm roaming public places as this is specifically the time I want my phone protected by security.|The app constantly sends notifications asking to open the app and leave it in power save mode for your reference power save mode is when you open the app and place your phone either upside down or face down.|I‚Äôm really sad that iOS users aren‚Äôt able to reliably do our part to help!|

If I do it for you can you do it for your loved ones.|The app itself only requests phone Num post code and age range. This is less than any services I sign up these days. I‚Äôm sure Gov knows more about me than these 3 things. It‚Äôs not tracking location either it only cares about if any identified case around you so they can contact you. The virus is so aggressive without using technology what‚Äôs our way out?|

jumblybum|29/04/2020|Notification spam. Lack of transparency.|Keeps spamming the same notification telling me that ‚Äòwe need you‚Äô. So I disabled notifications rendering the application useless since I used a fake mobile number.|Despite how terrible the app is. The lack of transparency is atrocious. I can‚Äôt trust the security of this application if they aren‚Äôt releasing the source code.|Some of the claims are technically questionable. How can it measure distance from Bluetooth signal strength that can vary between device.|It is stupid to spend so much producing this application which hardly anyone will use. Rather then just enforcing masks in public like other countries. The only reason I can think for the existence of this app is is that it is either:|- Intended as a safety blanket for those getting ‚Äòanxious‚Äô because they lack any mental resilience and can‚Äôt handle just staying the hell at home.|- Some high level government tech illiterate thought this was a good idea.|
evie.evie.e|29/04/2020|Good|Even if you can‚Äôt find the app if you get someone to send it to you it works just as well but you have to have apple store or google or something else play but really good and easy|

It‚Äôs the same problem over and over again ... error in verifying phone number and verification code is never sent. All details are correct. I hear other people are having the same issue. Is it a bug or an overloaded system or a phone company vs phone company issue? We‚Äôre with Telstra. Sure wish the government could get it sorted out.

Sari us|27/04/2020|Disgraceful|The app works and installed easy.|Computer nerds around Australia are wanting to get the source code for this app so they can dissect it and see exactly what it does and how it works. If the Govt really have nothing to hide why are they not prepared to release the source code. After all it‚Äôs just an app that supposedly doesn‚Äôt impinge on people‚Äôs privacy and civil liberties. Somehow I think there is more to it that what they say.|

Jordan396|27/04/2020|Wrong number|After providing mobile number for verifications the words ‚Äòwrong number?‚Äô shows up.

Stop wearing your tin-foil hats and giving yourselves so much credit that your data is even interesting in the first place lmao|If you don‚Äôt want to have the government finding you live off the grid. üì°|As for the issue of community tracing for the virus I think this is a great idea to make sure we‚Äôre all safe and let us able to trace something that is so difficult to do so beforehand.|
Momentarydivision|27/04/2020|Simple and a tool to get us back to the new normal|Simple registration and had it up in under a minute.|It amazes me the people who get on their soapbox when they don‚Äôt or simply can‚Äôt be bothered learning how the app has been architected. A FB comment summed everything up as ‚Äúit was built in America by Amazon they took our jobs and are storing data there!!‚Äù|For those who want to learn.. Amazon Web Services provide storage.. but with a core data centre based in sydney that Govt as well as banks are other firms needing reliable but secure cloud storage. It‚Äôs not Amazon retail and the app was built here as seen by the various articles citing Govt hiring developers.|I‚Äôm not associated with the app but I do build apps and it‚Äôs frustrating when ill informed user fear-mong those who genuinely want to make use of it and help fellow Aussies out.|
frustrated:((|27/04/2020|Try a little harder|Can‚Äôt believe the number of people coming here to rate the app 1 star because the phone verification ‚Äúisn‚Äôt working‚Äù... have you ever signed up to anything before? When there is a country code at the start drop the zero off of your phone number do this and the verification works without a problem. Don‚Äôt waste people‚Äôs time writing negative reviews just learn to think for yourself or do some simple googling üôÑ|
Howdrive|27/04/2020|Easy to register|Privacy looks good. Everything is encrypted not even users can see the information collected. When entering your phone number drop the first ‚Äò0‚Äô of your number as +61 has already been entered. Age range is to enable prioritisation of those to contact first and Post Code so they know which State should‚Äôve contacting you.|
Wonderwomanjane|26/04/2020|Easy|Worked without a hitch. Just make sure when prompted to enter your phone number to leave out the first 0 otherwise it will not work. (Standard when asked for your phone number and our country code +61 is already entered.)|
gerald_of_rivia|26/04/2020|Ignore the bad reviews the app is fine|You can register your number fine people just ignored all of the instructions and didn‚Äôt wait until 6pm when registration opened.|Your data is safe there‚Äôs a 5 year gaol term for anyone who accesses it for any reason even through a court order and you can use a fake name if you want (I have) no other private details are required other then a post code and a phone number.|Pls download this app. The eyes of the world are upon us to witness the first major country to beat the virus we‚Äôre almost there.|

disappointed-993|26/04/2020|Privacy protection is too notch.|On hearing the conditions put on the data collected and the fact that the code is open source I really cannot think of any extra steps the government could take to protect my privacy. I am an app developer and definitely no supporter of the current prime minister.|
Rthumma|26/04/2020|Successfully registered|Guess everyone typed 0 as well for phone number where as should have started with 4 as the country code prefix is already part of the app.|
TashaaGoddess|26/04/2020|Had no issues|Anyone reading this leave out the 0 at the start of your phone number and see if that works. So mine would be +61 412345862 or whatever instead of 04..... I had no issues verifying my mobile number at all.|
Ajc411983|26/04/2020|App works|For all those that say it does not work after the county code (+61) that is already entered out your mobile number in but without the first zero. This is standard practice when entering a mobile number after a country code!|
Duzntmattr anyways|26/04/2020|Really?|I read here that many people can‚Äôt get past the phone registration.|Here is a helpful reply..|drop the ‚Äú0‚Äù at the beginning of your mobile phone number.|For example if your number is|0415 123 456|Then enter-|415 123 456|Done easy peasy.|
KSil94|26/04/2020|For everyone commenting on the error!|You must be entering your phone number incorrectly.|It needs to be entered by dropping the 0 - as you would if you were calling an Australian mobile from overseas.|For example 0412 345 678 would become|64 412 345 678.|I did this and I got the pin within 4 seconds of hitting submit.|
Dave42.Zip|26/04/2020|Initially Verification Issue but Sorted Now :)|Initially it could no recognise my mobile number to send a verification code. Obviously teething issue which they have sorted and all registered no problems now :)|

S2F97|26/04/2020|Easy registration|Simply looked at so many registration fails. Do not put zero at the start. It will send a pin code to your mobile. Insert the code and you are ready to go.|The Wrong Number in blue is simply if you have entered the wrong number. Otherwise ignore it.|
Voods9832|26/04/2020|Don‚Äôt put a 0 at the start of your phone number|For everyone saying your number wasn‚Äôt working when it prompts you for your number you DO NOT include the zero at the start. If you number was 0412 345 678 then you should put the following after the 61.... 412 345 678. Hope this helps.|
kaz6193|26/04/2020|Signed up|Signed and verified in about 90 seconds - just had to walk upstairs for phone signal to get the verification code.|
myles<|26/04/2020|Drop the 0 from the start of your mobile number|eg the number 0455 555 555 should be entered as 455555555 (drop the zero)|
nickjs7|26/04/2020|Sign up works|Enter your mobile number without the ‚Äò0‚Äô at the beginning because the ‚Äò+61‚Äô area code is there|
Morphkurt|26/04/2020|Worked perfectly|Took me 10s sign up and successfully received the verification code.|
Crispy0001|26/04/2020|Works fine.|The app works fine.|Just don‚Äôt put the 0 in from the front of your mobile number.|61 0141 should be 61 141|
Adza1|26/04/2020|Can‚Äôt Verify phone number|I want to use this app but I can‚Äôt be sent the code to verify my phone number|
pingudownunder|26/04/2020|PIA not released neither is source code|More broken promises ... also this app doesn‚Äôt use the APIs being delivered by Apple and Google so for Bluetooth to work you have to have the app running and in the foreground? How useful is that ...|
ant1993n|26/04/2020|For those at phone verification stage|Since they have included the +61 you don‚Äôt have to enter the first 0 of your mobile phone.|So if your phone number is 041234567. It‚Äôs actually +61 41234567. So enter 41234567 and you will get the SMS to verify.|
doitforall|26/04/2020|Verifying phone number|This is for those that have had trouble verifying their phone number.... drop the leading 0 it use international code (+61) so I think the 0 isn‚Äôt necessary. I did it and had no trouble.|

safteythird|26/04/2020|Easy to register|Used my mobile number without the 0 (due to country code being added by default) and it worked first go.|
YokaV|26/04/2020|Can‚Äôt verify|App does not recognise my phone number. I did my husband‚Äôs phone for him and there was no problem.This needs to be fixed urgently as many potential participators will be lost.|
Ddownes|26/04/2020|All worked perfectly|Downloaded and installed fine. Registration was straight forward and worked without issue.|Some other reviews suggest not being able to register their mobile numbers. I think this may be because they are not dropping 0 off the front of their number as is the standard when using the international dial code +61|
san-against-covid|26/04/2020|Works smoothly|Installed easily- did not face the problem of the phone number verification. It took about a minute to get the verification code though.|
Eli-shaw|26/04/2020|All good|App works fine. Added my mobile phone number without the 0 my wife added the 0. It worked both ways. Got the text and entered the confirmation code. Accepted all questions. Up and running.|
useyourbrain2020|26/04/2020|Works fine to me|To all those people who can‚Äôt understand how to enter a phone number properly then listen and learn. +61 is our region code. So all you have to do is drop the 0 from your number and enter it in. Eg. your phone number is 0412 345 678. In the app it would be +61 412 345 678.|
LukeMcCallum|26/04/2020|If you use Facebook Google or Amazon don‚Äôt pretend. You don‚Äôt care about privacy.|Despite the negative press I‚Äôm happy to install the app as I am out and about seeing clients so anything I can do to help myself and clients I‚Äôll do.|
Luketoh|26/04/2020|Easy to install and activate|Simple app to install and activate. Those having issues should not include the 0 in front of their mobile numbers because when the country code is already included you drop the first zero in the number.|App developer should automatically check for the zero and drop it for the users.|
jenarch16|26/04/2020|There are NO set-up problems with this app|All those people giving this app 1 star as they were not able to complete their registration - i.e. could not enter their phone number tried to register too early. They did not bother to actually read or listen to any information when the app was launched.|Negative reviews written early on the 26/4/2020 referencing contact number issues should simply be IGNORED.|
Stevie7677|26/04/2020|Easy to use!|The Australian International Dialing Code +61 is part of the mobile phone number registration therefore don‚Äôt include the 0 at the beginning of your mobile number that is the reason why so many of you are having registration issues.|

Btegcl|26/04/2020|Easy to use|The easiest app to download. I understand that some people are having trouble with the mobile phone number. Given the mobile starts with the Australian international prefix (+61) you then need to enter your mobile without the first 0 e.g. (+61) 400 000 000.|
Young Tully üòô|26/04/2020|Easy install|No problem installing. Accepted my mobile number straight away. I dropped the first 0 as country code was in front|
it worked first time|26/04/2020|Works perfectly|Assuming you remove the first ‚Äò0‚Äô from your mobile number - as when there is international code the first ‚Äò0‚Äô isn‚Äôt needed - it registered straight away and was up and running in less than 30 seconds|
Convenient App....96|26/04/2020|Use the international code|When entering your mobile number the app shows the Australian international code (+61) so type everything after the first 0 for example if your number is 0412 345 678 you only need to input ‚Äú412 345 678‚Äù because the international code is at the start|
Debdu44|26/04/2020|How to fix mobile verification|When u put your number in drop the first 0 in your number. The app has +61 which is Aus international prefix you need to drop the first 0 then you will get the code ie if number is 012345678 you enter 12355678|
docfrommelb|26/04/2020|Works fine|Download installed OK registered easy - reminder to omit the initial zero since it prompts with the international +61 code. Works fine after that. IOS inserts the pin code automatically making it easy.|

D1273773|26/04/2020|Works for me!|I don‚Äôt know why so many people have issues registering their mobile numbers.|When entering your mobile number don‚Äôt enter the leading zero (0) of your number (as your number is preceded by the country code). Hope that helps!|
Hushles|26/04/2020|All good right now|When typing in the numberdo not put the first 0.|Everything is good right nowhope it will help.And making Australia great again|
Katrinastrat|26/04/2020|Verify phone number|I think the app is a great idea and for those who can‚Äôt get past the phone number verification question ensure you DON‚ÄôT include the zero at the start of your mobile number. After the country code of 61 add your mobile phone number without the zero at the start. Wondering if this may have been your problem as mine went through easily first go.|
Calypso Lulu|26/04/2020|Mobile number|For everyone saying they cannot enter mobile-|Please omit the zero at the beginning of your mobile number as it‚Äôs a 61 area code entry. Then it should be fine.|Stay safe everyone. This will help us contain this virus....|
ffffffftttttyyyuu|26/04/2020|Verification Code|Didn‚Äôt initially send verification code out but when I turned off wifi and re-started app installation it worked perfectly|

matt098123|26/04/2020|Simple install|Impressed by ease of install.|As it‚Äôs Australian only remove the country code and allow ppl to put in their typical mobile number (prefix with 0 instead of +61)... this will save some ppl from claiming it doesn‚Äôt work|

AmericanAmbrose|26/04/2020|Community equanimity|First let me start off by saying I‚Äôm an American as such liberty and privacy are deeply important. But there is one idea that underlines all of that and that is the value of the community itself in general the community must be safe or individual rights and freedoms mean little. Can I having this data be abused! Absolutely in many different ways. However I think we have to trust for the sake of the community as a whole and accept the risk to the individual. It is said that those who give up liberty and rights in fear do not deserve either liberty or rights. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going on here at least not for me. It‚Äôs about safety I will give up some of my freedom to keep the community safe as a whole. And maybe just maybe we can come out the other side of all this as a better community one that actually looks after each other in the world around us.
