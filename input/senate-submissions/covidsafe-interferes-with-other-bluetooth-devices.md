# Reviews from Google Store and Apple AppStore

The table below was generated by filtering through the data captured in the <a href="apple-appstore-reviews-of-covidsafe">Apple Appstore Reviews of COVIDSafe</a> <a href="google-appstore-reviews-of-covidsafe">Google Appstore Reviews of COVIDSafe</a> senate submissions using the following command:


```shell
cat 2020-05-22-covidsafe-apple-reviews.csv  | egrep -i "disconnect|drops|dropping|interfere|diabetes|hearing|aid" | grep -iv "mobile number" > bluetooth-problems-apple-appstore-reviews.csv
cat 2020-05-22-covidsafe-google-reviews.csv  | egrep -i "disconnect|drops|dropping|interfere|diabetes|hearing|aid" | grep -iv "mobile number" > bluetooth-problems-google-appstore-reviews.csv
cat bluetooth-problems-google-appstore-reviews.csv bluetooth-problems-apple-appstore-reviews.csv > bluetooth-problems-appstore-reviews.csv
```

Any review including the words (case insensitive) "mobile number" or "phone number" were excluded due to the high number reports from people who were unable to register. This problem is explained in the <a href="problems-preventing-registration-in-covidsafe">Problems preventing registration in COVIDSafe</a> senate submission.

Finally, some manual cleanup was performed. The raw-data is available to download:

Would be better if this app could be put to sleep manually when not needed  like when at home. I'll give it a bit longer to see if you resolve                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

In my experience the app does not drain my battery with responsible use. And it does not interfere with my Bluetooth headphones. I cannot believe people who complain about the ease of use  security or privacy.

It is a bit annoying. I have to unpair my phone and cars hands free and again pair them up. An urgent fix is needed for this issue.

Makes it unusable and force stopping it while listening is the only way to stop the interference.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Typed the pin exactly as sent. Said it was invalid. Double checked. Yup I got it right. Hit resend pin link and nothing happened nothing I can do except unibstall. Will try to install again. Great idea...

Fix that issue and I will reinstall. Nothing worse than listening to music or phone conversations and the connection drops because this app is pinging.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

But there is one idea that underlines all of that and that is the value of the community itself in general the community must be safe or individual rights and freedoms mean little. Can I having this data be abused! Absolutely in many different ways. However I think we have to trust for the sake of the community as a whole and accept the risk to the individual. It is said that those who give up liberty and rights in fear do not deserve either liberty or rights. That’s not what’s going on here at least not for me. It’s about safety I will give up some of my freedom to keep the community safe as a whole. And maybe just maybe we can come out the other side of all this as a better community one that actually looks after each other in the world around us.

Media promised me that it’s for our own good! They said “the app won’t track you *it simply digitises where you’ve been and who you’ve been in contact with* ” See it’s totally different! They just want to know where you go and who you talk to. That’s all. Nothing to see here! Nothing fishy about that at all Guess who got the contract to “store the data”? It’s owned by the “wealthiest man on earth” and the company starts with A and end with mazon.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

I’m still waiting for one of these armchair tech geniuses to tell me how an app that doesn’t even request location services can track me. Furthermore why are they so paranoid? Have they seen government spies hiding in their front garden lately or something? Look Karen I don’t think they could care less what you do so why would they want to track you. This app is great. Uses little battery and mobile data. The more downloads there are the faster we’ll get out of our homes and the sooner lives get back to normal. It’ll tell you if you’ve bumped into someone with the virus to protect you and your family too.

I did give high rating because the concept is good!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

This version says ‘open’ and the minister has said it has fixed the problems that require foreground. Can we get an answer as to if it needs to be in the foreground to work?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

As I’m as hearing to the social distancing regulations the only people who I’m ever in contact with for more than 15 minutes are the people in my house. The most likely place I’m going to contact this virus is while shopping and the people I pass in the shops won’t be registered. The serving problem with it is Bluetooth which I need to remember to turn on when I leave the house but turn off at home or my phone automatically connects to random home devices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

The daily ‘alert’ messages which are just advertising were distracting and annoying. I disabled alerts for the app and then the app said they are required. There is no explanation why and of course the government has gone back on its promise to open source the app and release an independent security audit report. So thanks but no thanks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

I can’t leave my phone unlocked whilst I’m roaming public places as this is specifically the time I want my phone protected by security. The app constantly sends notifications asking to open the app and leave it in power save mode for your reference power save mode is when you open the app and place your phone either upside down or face down.

As I’m quite a heavy user of these headphones unfortunately I can’t use the app at the same time. This issue with the music/headphones cutting out periodically (every 20mins or so? Sometimes more frequently) seemed to only begin when I’d installed the app.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

This could discourage people who commute/working by cars (connecting with Bluetooth in vehicles) or people who worked in professional service industry (who are always on Bluetooth headphones) to install the app                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Until health authorities / the CMO acknowledges that COVID-19 can be spread with contact a LOT less than 15 minutes and remember that this is not the flu... This app needs a custom sensitivity setting. To allow me to set my own time between 1 and 15 minutes. The app is ineffective otherwise. Privacy concerns are also moot while the app isn’t sensitive enough and collect enough data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

Be cautious CGM users!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
