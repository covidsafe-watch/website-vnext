# Overview

No industry best-practices were implemented at launch, including but not limited to:

* A bug bounty (which would provide a clear path for reporting issues)
* A security contact address, separate from general enquiries (allowing for prioritisation and triaging).
* Source code available at launch (making it easier for analysis)
* Engagement on reported issues to coordinate disclosure.

There has been no public acknowledgement of issues raised, nor has there been any communication around interim mitigations or workarounds.

This has been done better in other countries, e.g. UKâ€™s NHSX recently described their engagement with the community in a <a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/blog-post/nhs-covid-19-app-security-two-weeks-on">blog post</a>. See also the <a href="https://twitter.com/VTeagueAus/status/1262655345001820161">Twitter thread from Vanessa Teague</a>. They also have a <a href="https://hackerone.com/nhscovid19app">HackerOne bug bounty</a>, specifically for their COVID-19 tracker app, <a href="https://hackerone.com/sg-vdp">as does Singapore</a>.


In the case of the two long-term tracking issues that were fixed, neither recommended fixes were implemented. The recommendation was to remove the unnecessary features altogether to avoid any further risks, and also to add comments to prevent future regressions. Instead, workarounds were added to the existing fragile code.

It is worth noting how much better the response from the DTA was to the iPhone crash, compared to the privacy issues. As is to be expected, a crashing app is far easier for the public to understand than an invisible privacy leak. This difference was not just in terms of time-to-fix, but also in the engagement from the DTA.
