<thead><tr class="tableizer-firstrow"><th>Lightning!72!</th><th>26/04/2020</th><th>No problems signing up Those saying they canâ€™t get their number recognised have you tried leaving off the leading zero? Because the app has the +61 at the front this usually means you enter your phone number without the leading zero. I imagine theyâ€™ve put the 61 there to ensure that only Australian numbers can participate which is sensible. I left off the leading zero and got in straight away with no issues at all. I think this app is a great initiative. Iâ€™m not worried about the so called problems of authorities knowing where I am. They can already do that anyway through the phoneâ€™s location service and through the gps on my car. This is designed for better tracing of who you happen to be around in the shops or at work or wherever to meet the response to the virus so Iâ€™ll support it. </th></tr></thead><tbody>
 <tr><td>brass razoo</td><td>26/04/2020</td><td>Installed perfectly on iPhone I have an Apple iPhone X running iOS 13.4.1 I downloaded the app from from the App Store and installed without any problems at all. There is a small glitch which is after you enter your mobile phone number as well as the â€˜continueâ€™ button the â€˜verily phone numberâ€™ text was also showing however the â€˜continueâ€™ was much more obvious and when pressed I received my PIN number immediately. As the app has +61 there is no need to enter the first zero of your phon number. We all need to be even more aware of safe actions and behaviours now some restrictions are being eased. So please install the app and use it. To all those who flocked to Bondi and other beaches against instructions did you know the Governor of New York has said the major reason New York as such a massive death toll compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles is that New York introduced lock-down and social distancing 1 week later. Only 1 week made a difference of thousands of deaths so please use the app follow the rules and was your hands (properly) with soap and water. May we all emerge safe and well however we must all do the right thing. </td></tr>

Only problem is I nearly uploaded my information at the bottom where it asks â€˜has a health professional asked you to upload your information?â€™ I think thatâ€™s just for confirmed cases???! Not worried at all about scaremongering of the government having my info - I have a Medicare card bank accounts a passport licence etc - pretty sure I have enough for them to track me if they could be bothered! and if privacy is really a concern to you - why are you people on Facebook Twitter Instagram PayPal eBay etc etc etc.... they have more than enough on you if they want! Do it - look after each other Australia - letâ€™s not be like Europe or the USA and lose so many lives. </td></tr>
 <tr><td>KvaziReviewer</td><td>26/04/2020</td><td>Not working well not privacy friendly This app has failed in two ways. First you need to have this app always running with your phone fully unlocked all the time to make it work. This is how iOS was designed to prevent privacy abuse apps in background do not get a change to always broadcast data via bluetooth. The government had a chance to avoid this problem because Apple and Google are coming up with their own contact tracing solution that they could implement in this app (Contact Tracing framework) but the government decided not to use it. Secondly they ask you to provide your contact details at the point of the registration. They could do that when you are notified about contacting someone with the virus instead. There is no real reason to collect this information for every single person and store it on a server. </td></tr>
 <tr><td>AdamB-GC</td><td>26/04/2020</td><td>Easy to setup I see many people saying they canâ€™t get the app to work because they canâ€™t verify their mobile number. I had no trouble with my setup. The app did throw up an error when I entered the first 4 digits of my mobile number starting with 0414 but if I just entered 414 (No zero as the first digit) and then entered the rest of the numbers it verified and sent me a pin # to enter on my iPhone. If you tried imputing your mobile number without the first zero and it didnâ€™t work then I would assume it was an overload error on the server with this app currently ranking as the #1 downloaded app in the Apple App Store. </td></tr>

I would like to see a data count on the app to show how many people I have been closer than 1.5 metres and 15 minute duration. This will give me indication that the app is working on my phone and I can verify the numbers I have in close proximity.

What will this mean for drug dealers already struggling to reorganise their supply chains after having been hit by the pandemic? It may surprise you to hear that many are not covered by the force majeure clauses that you and I take for granted. And what about men who cheat on their wives. As if it wasnâ€™t hard enough for them to do so in self-isolation now they will have to worry about the government tracing app. Think of the plight of Barnaby Joyce for one. Yes this app may help us return to some degree of normalcy in society. Yes it may allow us to share more time with friends and family to free the aged from a terrible period of isolation. Yes it may help restore employment and self-fulfilment to the millions who have been rendered unemployed by the virus. But I ask you is it really worth the cost? </td></tr>

For those concerned re privacy this app holds less information than Facebook or any other social media site you also can use a pseudonym.

Privacy-wise they've taken the right approach. It'll still be useful even without a massive install base. If it notifies even one person who interacts with vulnerable people that they need to get tested it will have been worthwhile. It only asks for details that are already publicly available on the electoral roll plus your phone number. Worked perfectly for me. </td></tr>

Because of my profession Iâ€™m VERY familiar with information security the importance of data privacy and how data can be exploited. From what I can tell this app has been created with the highest standards and the best of intentions. Before you criticise it for nefarious motives read the privacy policy and SEE what great lengths they have gone to make sure it is effective but minimally invasive.

In relation to privacy using the proper API will render the collection of every users name and number completely unnecessary.

If you have ever had anything to do with Aus Gov they already have more info than this app provides them with. I used a pseudonym no problem. It doesnâ€™t ask to use your location services (so no itâ€™s not a â€˜tracking appâ€™) it only uses Bluetooth signals to ping off other app users (thatâ€™s why it asks you to keep app running in background and Bluetooth on). You enter your mobile number so if a user is diagnosed and they upload their data which has used Bluetooth to ping other users (in close proximity for more than 15mins) by putting our mobile numbers in it allows the health dept. to be able to contact us not by using a location service. If you have any app on your phone that uses location services itâ€™s more invasive than this one. You have to upload your data for it to be accessible otherwise it is kept on your phone. Even if it did use location services (which it doesnâ€™t) Iâ€™d rather give access to the govt of my location for a couple of months than potentially be in ICU or be responsible for someone else being in ICU. </td></tr>

I restarted my phone a few times along to way which sometimes helped to get a little further. Eventually I TURNED OFF MY MOBILEâ€™S WI-FI to force it to use 4G then I re-did the activation steps and it all worked perfectly and very quickly.

 <tr><td>timmalone</td><td>1/05/2020</td><td>Good idea but... ...not very clear how itâ€™s actually implemented. The notification sent every morning implies you need the app open on your screen to be effective. Why not take a little extra time to develop something that works in the background? Sure millions might download but if itâ€™s a requirement to keep it open and few do itâ€™s not gonna help much. Also the daily notification is annoying. When I turned notifications off the app implied it would no longer work without it. Want to help but do I really need a notification every morning to do so? Minus one star for each of the above but 3 stars for: a simple on boarding process; a clean design; and for getting it out quickly. Hoping it still works in the background! </td></tr>
 <tr><td>darkDancer82</td><td>1/05/2020</td><td>Needs "Background App Refresh" I've deleted this junk app. It doesn't function correctly. I don't want notifications on period! Bluetooth Sharing is a security risk like writing your password down on paper and putting it on display in a public place. Other apps have been able to successfully implement "Background App Refresh" without the app having to be open or running in the tray. Many times I've left the house or gone to the shops I always forget to make sure it's running mainly because it's not an app I actively use. Set and Forget would be best for this app to function. Apple have integrated Covid-19 support in an upcoming update which therefore make this app redundant. There is a slim chance you will find this working when passing another person with it running as you've designed. </td></tr>

Developers please note- if you continue to annoy me I will delete the app. EDIT - ok I get it now. You open the app & leave it open.

The most likely place Iâ€™m going to contact this virus is while shopping and the people I pass in the shops wonâ€™t be registered.

Also mandatory vaccination forces the individual to accept all the risks while removing the right to compensation except in cases of blatant culpability. I am surprised that it isnâ€™t mandatory to get a clean bill of health immediately prior to each vaccination.

 <tr><td>iiNetter</td><td>17/05/2020</td><td>An unfortunate necessity In addition to my previous reviews below I understand that Apple donâ€™t approve apps that utilise undocumented/private APIs but I would have thought that given the current circumstances they would be willing to make exceptions so apps like this can better integrate with the security features of iOS. This would be particularly important for devices that wonâ€™t receive iOS 13.4.5/13.5 and therefore wonâ€™t receive the Exposure Notification API feature that has been jointly developed by Apple and Google in response to the pandemic. Update to my previous review: Iâ€™ve just discovered that the tick boxes I referred to are still there but you now have to scroll down from the green image it simply wasnâ€™t obvious there was more below this screen until I accidentally scrolled upwards while the image was displayed. Perhaps the fact there is more below the image could be made more obvious with a downward facing arrow particularly when the app is unable to function or better yet the part of the screen containing the tick/crosses is brought up over the green image when the app is unable to function. In addition to my previous review below I think the update has lost some of the user friendliness that the first version had. The updated version no longer displays the four reasons why the app is unable to function e.g. permissions Bluetooth disabled etc. with a green tick or red cross and instead just displays text suggesting that the user should check permissions even if the reason is simply because Bluetooth is disabled. Also the updated version of the app displays a green image which is a universally understood indication that something is working even if the app is unable to function at the very least the image displayed should be red in colour if/when the app is unable to function. Previous review: Would it be possible to enable health officials to contact you if/when necessary and send the PIN for enabling access to the contact information through the app in much the same way as Internet banking apps send One Time Passcodes therefore removing the requirement to provide a phone number? This might result in a higher rate of adoption of the app by those concerned about their privacy and reduce the time it takes for our lives to start safely going back to normal. </td></tr>

If I want pointless nagging about things - I would get back with my ex! I do not watch / listen to annoying ads on the tv / radio (I change stations or watch a DVD.). There is no where on the app to send feedback about this annoyance. I am sure that if I sent e-mails daily to the Prime Minister berating him he would have police (& possibly ASIO) on my doorstep telling my to cease. Well...This constant berating to do turn the Bluetooth on to register to have the app has now resulted in me ceasing this app. I am deleting it from my iPad and iPhone.
