# Usage of AWS was almost certainly the right decision.

A lot of attention has been paid to hypothetical concerns around the CLOUD Act, whereas real, practical concerns about the reliability and security of this data are easily answered by using AWS.

The process of onboarding Government services with AWS is well-understood and has had a lot of thought and attention paid to it over the past couple of years. AWS has received <a href="https://www.cyber.gov.au/irap/cloud-services">ASD certification via the IRAP</a>.

Whilst it would be fantastic to have a locally owned and operated provider in this space, there is no other certified provider that comes close to the level of service and functionality offered by AWS.
