# Preface

This document is a compilation of findings made by Geoffrey Huntley and the [COVIDSafe.watch](COVIDSafe.watch) community in relation to the COVIDSafe app. 

We have compiled this document with the aim of presenting our findings in a readable format for presentation to journalists and the Senate, in order to show the app’s significant privacy and security concerns that the community has uncovered.

# Aim

COVIDSafe is a mobile application released by the Australian Government, aimed at assisting with the contact tracing efforts by health authorities to slow the spread of COVID-19. Through research and reverse engineering done by a community of software engineers and security professionals, we have found several issues that expose serious privacy concerns and unnecessarily limits the COVIDSafe app from being used by large groups of people.

This document aims to summarise the serious problems present with the COVIDSafe mobile application, and the difficulties the community has faced in responsibly disclosing these problems to government agencies, including the Digital Transformation Agency.


# Executive Summary


*   Latest release of the COVIDSafe app (v1.0.16) did not address the vast majority of security and privacy issues raised.
    *   The update mainly comprised of visual changes
*   UniqueID does not necessarily refresh every 2 hours
    *   Potential risk of multi-day tracking of the same UniqueID
*   App records details about the messages it sends and receives in **unencrypted form**.
*   Privacy Policy for COVIDSafe app breached
*   iOS version is suboptimal when not in the foreground
*   No way to securely disclose contact information
*   No customer support
*   Government agencies (including Greg Hunt) are aware of these issues and acknowledged them, yet above mentioned issues haven’t been addressed
*   Source code has still not been publicly released by the government, despite [several promises](https://www.abc.net.au/radio/programs/am/heath-minister-says-govt-will-release-covidsafe-source-code/12187634) to do so, as well as it being suggested in the app’s [Application Privacy Impact Assessment](https://www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covidsafe-application-privacy-impact-assessment-agency-response)
*   Various functional definicines, privacy breaches and breaches of social contract 
*   Unneeded incompatibility with older Android Devices


# Breaches of Privacy Policy

The COVIDSafe app’s basic operation is to transmit and receive encrypted user IDs (UniqueID) with other users of the app. We understand that UniqueIDs received by the app are stored locally on the phone and the list of received UniqueIDs is only transmitted when explicitly uploaded by the user..

The app’s [Privacy Policy](https://www.health.gov.au/using-our-websites/privacy/privacy-policy-for-covidsafe-app) describes how the app will collect, store, use and store the user’s information. We have found that key parts of the policy do not reflect the real-world behaviour of the COVIDSafe app.


## Tracking of the encrypted user ID (UniqueID)

The Privacy Impact Assessment has stated the following:


> _8.18	The App will only accept the new Unique IDs if it is open and running. If the App successfully accepts the new Unique ID, an automatic message will be generated and sent back to the National COVIDSafe Data Store. This message will only effectively indicate a "yes (new Unique ID successfully delivered)" response to the National COVIDSafe Data Store. **If the App is not open and running, it will not be able to accept a new Unique ID. It will continue to store the previous Unique ID and use this when the App is opened, until a new Unique ID is generated and accepted**._

The Privacy Policy states that "An encrypted user ID will be created every 2 hours", and this represents a major flaw, in which it is possible for someone to be traced for more than 2 hours. This can lead to the same UniqueID being used for multiple days.


## Misrepresentation of stored data

The Privacy Policy has stated that the app only records the following contact data:



1. The encrypted user ID
2. Date and time of contact; and
3. Bluetooth signal strength of other COVIDSafe users with which you come into contact

It has also stated that "No user will be able to see the contact data stored on their device as it will be encrypted." This is not true:



*   The database also stores the model of the phone that sent the data
*   The database contents are stored in plaintext aside from the encrypted user ID.

The app is not collecting enough data or the right data to be able to detect "close contact" (distance of 1.5m for more than 15 minutes), even with server-side processing. Instead it collects and stores data from any phone within Bluetooth range, regardless of proximity. This is not what the general public would reasonably believe to be happening and breaches the implicit permission they are giving that their data only be collected by phones that are possible "close contacts" and not any phone within Bluetooth range, which could be in another room or on a different floor or even in a different building.


## Collection of Android device ID

On Android, the app collects the user's device ID as part of the onboarding process. On versions of Android 8.0 and higher, this device ID is unique per app. However, on devices prior to Android 8.0, this device ID is only unique to the device (not per app) and can be easily obtained with access to the device. The collection of the device ID should be included in the privacy policy along with the other personal information the app collects.


# Accessibility issues

Several issues have been identified where several groups are unable to use the app, including:

*   Inability for international visitors to use the app
    *   App only available on Australian version of Google Play Store and Apple App Store
    *   The app only accepts Australian phone numbers (what if you’re roaming with an international SIM while located in Australia?)
*   Inability for those without mobile phone service to be onboarded to the app
    *   There is no form of two-factor authentication other than SMS (although this has been alleviated somewhat with Telstra’s SMS over WiFi)
    *   Users can only be onboarded on mobile data (e.g. 3G/4G network data). 


# Lack of end user support

The app store reviews contain hundreds of negative reviews, none of which are being addressed. There is no social media team where users could reach out for support. 

There's absolutely no way to get support ("faq and help buttons") until you have registered. Which means if people can't register they just give up and don't know where to turn.


# Lack of response to raised security issues

> "In private I tried numerous times contacting the DTA, the minister of Services Australia and the media/privacy departments and the Australian Signals Directorate to pick up the phone. I was not the only researcher who experienced these problems.

# Unneeded incompatibility with Android 5.0

 \
Android 5.0 Lollipop was launched by Google back in late 2014 preceded by 5.1 Lollipop in early 2015. As of April 2020 both run on 2.64% of Australia’s Android Devices which make 55% of the wider Market. ([Source](https://gs.statcounter.com/android-version-market-share/mobile/australia/#monthly-202004-202004-bar)) The COVIDSafe app has found to have an unneeded compatibility with those devices as it’s minimum version supported is 6.0.

 \
 \
Android 5.0 introduced the functionality of Bluetooth Low Energy Broadcasts, which is what the COVIDSafe app uses to emit the identifiers. The method used to code this functionality in the COVIDSafe app should run without a problem on both Android 5.0 & 5.1. \
 \


The other thing is that the libraries **(Sets of prewritten code)** that are available to the public of which the COVIDSafe app is dependent upon are compatible with Android 5.0. \

One item that no one in the community can figure out is the closed source **(meaning private)** library called **"com.atlassian.mobilekit"** of which the COVIDSafe app is dependent upon. There is speculation that since the COVIDSafe app is dependent on this library, that it is forced to make the minimum version 6.0.  \
Atlassian, the creators of this library, could potentially make a derivative that works on 5.0 & 5.1 devices.

 \
The Digital Transformation Agency is working with Apple and Google on their improved bluetooth connectivity to implement into the COVIDSafe app. As of the preliminary documentation released by Google in April describing how this technology works on Android, it has outlined the minimum Android version required would be 5.0.

 \
If there are no issues with dependencies that the COVIDSafe app is reliant upon, the modification to the code is not difficult. Simply adjust the **"minSdkVersion"** number from 23 to 21.  \
This small change could enable the COVIDSafe app to reach that 3% that might really need it.

<em>The COVIDSafe application code is derived from Opentrace. In the OpenTrace source code, it sets up a timer to run here:</em>

<p>
<em>The main problem here is that it is continuously starting and stopping scans, using a timer. When the application is put into the background, the timer started on the main thread’s execution is paused, and scans do not run. When the application enters the foreground again, it runs immediately because the timer suddenly expires. It then may run again shortly after (as seen in the script output above).</em>
