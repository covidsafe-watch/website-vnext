# Overview

Minor user interface updates are prioritised over privacy issues, with the justification of "sprint planning". This is not how "agile software development" is supposed to work.

> When it comes to knowledge work, the type of items that teams get to work on varies in urgency, requirements, perceived business value and level of priority.
> 
> For example, a software development team has just gone live with their application. The team is now expected to work on both enhancements and maintenance work. At the start of the workday, they are scheduled to work on features for a planned release version and a few minor production issues. Midday comes and a security vulnerability has been reported, putting client data at risk. The team focuses attention to the production issue and works on it immediately. If this affects the teams work capacity, other work items might be halted to address the critical issue.
>
> This is much similar to the medical triage concept being used in the emergency department of hospitals. The triage nurse assesses each patient that arrives. Based on the severity of their condition, the triage nurse determines the order of patient treatment. A patient suffering from cardiac arrest will be considered a higher priority than a patient with a tummy ache.
> 
> Establishing a set of rules that govern how incoming work is treated enables teams to work in the best interest of the customer. Teams will also decrease the amount of time a task remains in the backlog.
