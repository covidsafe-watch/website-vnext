Status: Not submitted. Requires proof read and readability improvements.

# Overview

The source code for both apps was released on 08/05/2020, and has been updated within a couple of days of each subsequent release.

It is published with <a href="https://github.com/AU-COVIDSafe/mobile-android/blob/master/LICENSE.md">an unusually restrictive license</a> limiting the rights of its users, there are nod tests, the code contains very few comments, and it is impossible for a developer to build and run the application without first building their own test server (with no documentation on this process). At the very least a sample server should have been included.

Additionally, the repositories are read-only, there is no way for the community to provide fixes or improvements.

In addition to this, the <a href="https://www.ag.gov.au/RightsAndProtections/Privacy/Pages/COVIDSafelegislation.aspx">Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Act</a> contains extremely ambiguous wording around what a researcher may legally do with this application. As a result, the Government has made it extremely unappealing to try and help them.
