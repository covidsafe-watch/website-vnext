Geoffrey Huntley has seen no replies from customer support to app store reviews left by people who have been experiencing troubles downloading, registering and using the COVIDSafe application.

This goes against industry best practices.

Geoffrey Huntley attempted numerous times, in private, to bring this to the attention of the DTA, the minister of Services Australia and the media departments at Health/DTA. When working in the private didn't work, he turned to working in the public with Australian journalists to get this matter resolved.

It is still unresolved.

# Recommendations

Have an engaged customer support team on social media and on the app stores helping people.
