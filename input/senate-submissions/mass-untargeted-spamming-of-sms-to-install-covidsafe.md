> Why do I keep getting COVIDSafe messages and notifications on my phone when I've already downloaded the COVIDSafe app?
>
> If you've registered and installed the COVIDSafe app on your phones you have probably asked yourself this very question. Notifications or text messages from COVIDSafe have been flying thick and fast it seems.
>
> Queensland open-source software engineer Geoffrey Huntley explained that the federal government is using the notification window as a way of letting Australians know that the application is working successfully.
>
> And what about the text messages being sent directly to individual mobile phones?
>
>> "Theoretically, they could use the mobile numbers used in the registration process but that would be most likely against the privacy policy of COVIDSafe. So because of that, if true, they are highly likely defaulting to just spamming everyone.
>>
>> "It's just an SMS, it's got nothing to do with the app.
>>
>> "They've got no way of knowing if the app is installed or not - they are essentially sending an SMS to every mobile phone number in Australia that you should download the app.
>>
>> "It's like spam in your junk box - it's an SMS advertisement that the government is sending to everyone."
