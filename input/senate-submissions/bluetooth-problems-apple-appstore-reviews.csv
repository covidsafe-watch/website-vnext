brass razoo,26/04/2020,Installed perfectly on iPhone I have an Apple iPhone X running iOS 13.4.1 I downloaded the app from from the App Store and installed without any problems at all. There is a small glitch which is after you enter your mobile phone number as well as the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô button the ‚Äòverily phone number‚Äô text was also showing however the ‚Äòcontinue‚Äô was much more obvious and when pressed I received my PIN number immediately. As the app has +61 there is no need to enter the first zero of your phon number. We all need to be even more aware of safe actions and behaviours now some restrictions are being eased. So please install the app and use it. To all those who flocked to Bondi and other beaches against instructions did you know the Governor of New York has said the major reason New York as such a massive death toll compared to San Francisco and Los Angeles is that New York introduced lock-down and social distancing 1 week later. Only 1 week made a difference of thousands of deaths so please use the app follow the rules and was your hands (properly) with soap and water. May we all emerge safe and well however we must all do the right thing. 
Nisha...,26/04/2020,Simple and straightforward The news said it would be active at 6 pm however it worked for me at 5:48 pm and the final screen states that the app is active and I am registered. The security measures in place to protect the privacy of users are very comforting and I have no issues in letting the app use my Bluetooth (which is always on anyway) to assist in tracking and controlling the spread of Covid-19 
Professor Berry,26/04/2020,Andrew doesn‚Äôt run the press conference ‚ÄúAndrew I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve had several questions‚Äù the prime minister said. ‚ÄúAndrew I‚Äôm sorry Andrew. I know but you don‚Äôt run the press conference OK? So I‚Äôm going to go to other questions of members of the group. Katharine hasn‚Äôt had a question‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm happy to return to you but let‚Äôs just keep it civil. Katharine?‚Äù 
Victor's Girl,26/04/2020,Very simple to register I read all the reviews that said they couldn‚Äôt enter a phone number. As they were all written before the app was activated at 6 pm on 26/4 I presume that was the issue. I applied at 8.30 pm and got straight on. It was a very quick and easy process. 
Koolkaid,26/04/2020,Had to wait to enter phone number Downloaded straight away on first day but couldn‚Äôt register phone number. Came back after 6pm (when they said it would be active) and it worked 
Charamil,26/04/2020,Awesome recommend for anyone who wants to go outside. Only errors if you downloaded before 6pm. They said it would be ready from 6pm for anyone that wants to leave the house in 2020. Otherwise please do not leave your house for the next 8 months. 
xander y,26/04/2020,Easy to install Reviews who said they could not upload their phone numbers didn‚Äôt wait until the 6pm launch time today. Try again guys - so we can all get back to some kind of normal life 
Ruadhaidh,26/04/2020,Easy very easy! Very straightforward to register. Sensible permissions and privacy steps. Confirmation by SMS instantaneous. I think other reviewers must have been overly impatient to write off an app within a few minutes of the 6pm (according to SMH) launch. 
Garrethhh,26/04/2020,It is ready now If you tried earlier to setup it would not have worked they said ready after 6pm. All working well now. Support Australia getting back to normal by installing this app. 
Agcousins34,26/04/2020,Working fine I was able to register unlike the thousands that said it‚Äôs not working. Perhaps the issue is resolved now. Anyway here‚Äôs to the government tracking me as I sit on the couch 
Barnsy125,26/04/2020,Works fine! News outlets said to wait to 6pm to register. Predictably people ignored that advice and tried to register prematurely and then complained when it didn‚Äôt work. Go figure. Great initiative! Everyone get around it. 
Krummo,26/04/2020,Chill out it wasn‚Äôt active until 6pm Hearing lots of ‚Äòit doesn‚Äôt work‚Äô but the announcement was it won‚Äôt be active until 6pm. Now active and seems to be accepting the phone number registration 
CBEECH01,26/04/2020,To get passed mobile verification Make sure you are using mobile data disconnect any wifi connection. Let‚Äôs all do our part in returning to a normal life! 
RMtwentington81,26/04/2020,Works just fine Accepts my phone number. The media said it wouldn‚Äôt work before 6pm on the day it was released so I just waited until then to download. 
RhinoInAdelaide,26/04/2020,Just download it Important for EVERYONE to download and use this app. You may not be sick but you might be in contact with someone. Wouldn‚Äôt you like to me the community safe? 
S. M. A. Zaidi,26/04/2020,Good Work üëç Quick n easy to setup within a minute and quickly verified my number as well. Hope it will be effective too. Nice work Gov üëç 
m00n1,26/04/2020,Amazing Installed the app. My ex girlfriend came back. My friend paid me the money he owed. My kids started behaving. My car is now running smoothly. I got covid 19 but still. Pretty good outcome. 
Aidan 11,26/04/2020,Family is safe Just coughed in my room! The microphone picked it up and alerted my family downstairs! Now I can‚Äôt leave great..... 
maggie gb 29,26/04/2020,Easy!! Worked just like it said. Installation took 1 minute. Support this with all your friends. 
AdelaideTown,26/04/2020,Simple & easy to use Great to see a Government app that is simple and straight forward to use 
StewartGamble,26/04/2020,Optional Phone number verification please I would trust this app more if verifying my phone number was optional. I don't want a phone number Bluetooth MAC address correlation ending up in the wrong hands. Having said that the rest of the security seems sound at this stage. Deleted for now waiting in hope for ver 1.1. Thanks for your hard and quick work getting this out! 
Jonframe,26/04/2020,Sign Up Fails Cannot complete the initial sign-up. ‚ÄúError verifying phone number‚Äù for both full number and dropping the leading zero. Oh well. Not much use if you can‚Äôt get the very first steps to work.. 
Eryn1978,26/04/2020,Error at phone number Tried to sign up and it won‚Äôt let me get past adding my phone number. It said it can‚Äôt be verified even though it‚Äôs entered correctly. 
triple5adam,26/04/2020,My taxes paid for this This app was garbage. I couldn‚Äôt even register. Full of bugs. I thought this app was designed to fight bugs. Not create more. Would not recommend. 
TheAussieGeek,26/04/2020,Invaid phone number It will not accept Aus phone numbers 
disappointed-993,26/04/2020,Privacy protection is too notch. On hearing the conditions put on the data collected and the fact that the code is open source I really cannot think of any extra steps the government could take to protect my privacy. I am an app developer and definitely no supporter of the current prime minister. 
KSil94,26/04/2020,For everyone commenting on the error! You must be entering your phone number incorrectly. It needs to be entered by dropping the 0 - as you would if you were calling an Australian mobile from overseas. For example 0412 345 678 would become 64 412 345 678. I did this and I got the pin within 4 seconds of hitting submit. 
Dan089,26/04/2020,Easy sign up Are the people getting a sign up error dropping the zero from their phone number? It has the +61 so don‚Äôt include 0 Like 404 123 123 
AmericanAmbrose,26/04/2020,Community equanimity First let me start off by saying I‚Äôm an American as such liberty and privacy are deeply important. But there is one idea that underlines all of that and that is the value of the community itself in general the community must be safe or individual rights and freedoms mean little. Can I having this data be abused! Absolutely in many different ways. However I think we have to trust for the sake of the community as a whole and accept the risk to the individual. It is said that those who give up liberty and rights in fear do not deserve either liberty or rights. That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs going on here at least not for me. It‚Äôs about safety I will give up some of my freedom to keep the community safe as a whole. And maybe just maybe we can come out the other side of all this as a better community one that actually looks after each other in the world around us. I‚Äôm grateful to be in Australia üòå Ambrose   covid19 - 2020 
brett said,27/04/2020,Would a watch app be better? It‚Äôs a good initiative and the app is well considered and designed taking into account the turn around time required. Not an expert would a watch app be better considering the limitations of Bluetooth on a phone? Locked screen background processing etc. 
anon_@&$,27/04/2020,Technology clash Constant Bluetooth search by the app for nearby devices severely interferes with performance of other Bluetooth technologies in vicinity eg computer peripherals. Have to turn Phone (and therefore covidsafes) Bluetooth to be able to continue to work. This then requires me to actually remember to turn it on again when leaving the house. Not a great user experience 
logan coolum,27/04/2020,Great app Very informative and inspirational. Gets somewhat political near the end and you get sick of hearing the blokes point of view when he keeps butting in and talking over the Coronavirus app. We‚Äôll done guys keep em coming! 
WCSutto,27/04/2020,Buggy but important. Couldn‚Äôt get my verification PIN until I disconnected from my home wifi. Try this if you‚Äôre having trouble. 
Daynzey,27/04/2020,Difficult I saw this app and thought that getting it would be a good idea but when I tried to sign in but I couldn‚Äôt it said there was something wrong with my phone number and I know there is nothing wrong with it 
Lost_in_Ideas,27/04/2020,Cannot get a pin I have downloaded this app and then tried and it has said many times there has been an error then I deleted and I repeated those steps and it still occurred I was happy to get the app and play my part to stop the spread but I am now sad that I cannot do that 
non tech older person,27/04/2020,A non tech older person I have no idea if I have registered for the conavirous app It sort of appeared on my phone (I am not sure what I actually pressed to )BUT I have not downloaded any of the data said to be required such as phone number date of birth etc So am I registered and if so how do I check this and if not what do I need to now do? 
Ambodive,27/04/2020,Will not accept Mobile No. Will not accept Australian mobile phone number - either dropping the leading ‚Äò0‚Äô or including it... totally useless as a result. 
Leatherrubberwetsuit,27/04/2020,Accessible sms It‚Äôs good idea for Deaf people and hard of hearing. ! If call by voice will not answer voice caller. 
janryan9a,27/04/2020,Can‚Äôt download COVIDSafe App I was sent the code but the app said it was wrong. I have been unable to get past the point where it says to download information. I tried several times but still can‚Äôt download it. Frustrating 
frtyuiio,27/04/2020,Can‚Äôt register Just said error to send me code. 
-Grant1964-,28/04/2020,Will only register if not on wifi Tried 30+ times over two days to try and register the app. It kept telling me that there was a problem with the phone number I was entering. Same issue for both numbers I entered (dual sim phone). As a last resort I disconnected from my wifi and tried and it registered immediately. The instructions need to specify that the phone cannot be on wifi to register. 
rasthasan,28/04/2020,Definitely the one to download! Media promised me that it‚Äôs for our own good! They said ‚Äúthe app won‚Äôt track you *it simply digitises where you‚Äôve been and who you‚Äôve been in contact with* ‚Äù See it‚Äôs totally different! They just want to know where you go and who you talk to. That‚Äôs all. Nothing to see here! Nothing fishy about that at all Guess who got the contract to ‚Äústore the data‚Äù? It‚Äôs owned by the ‚Äúwealthiest man on earth‚Äù and the company starts with A and end with mazon. 
aaamazed,28/04/2020,Turn off wifi to register your number Tried many times (apple phone) but it said 'unable to verify your number'. Finally found the solution - turn off wifi registers instantly. 
app_user_b01,28/04/2020,You‚Äôre an idiot if you don‚Äôt have it ‚ÄúItS gOiNg To TrAcK mY lOcAtIoN‚Äù ‚ÄúI dOnT wAnT tHe GoVeRnMeNt FoLlOwInG mY mOvEmEnTs‚Äù - said every halfwit on Facebook comments section. I‚Äôm still waiting for one of these armchair tech geniuses to tell me how an app that doesn‚Äôt even request location services can track me. Furthermore why are they so paranoid? Have they seen government spies hiding in their front garden lately or something? Look Karen I don‚Äôt think they could care less what you do so why would they want to track you. This app is great. Uses little battery and mobile data. The more downloads there are the faster we‚Äôll get out of our homes and the sooner lives get back to normal. It‚Äôll tell you if you‚Äôve bumped into someone with the virus to protect you and your family too. Just download the damn app. 
CoffsLass,28/04/2020,Doesn‚Äôt Work Has Bugs I downloaded this app as it was announced on the 5 o‚Äôclock news. On the first attempt it said there was an error in verifying the phone number and it never texted a verification code. I tried it again and I got through. BUT my husband has never been able to set it up. Despite many attempts including deleting the app and redownloading he has never succeeded in getting it set up. It‚Äôs the same problem over and over again ... error in verifying phone number and verification code is never sent. All details are correct. I hear other people are having the same issue. Is it a bug or an overloaded system or a phone company vs phone company issue? We‚Äôre with Telstra. Sure wish the government could get it sorted out. My husband is a healthcare provider and this app would give us great peace of mind. Help! 
North Sydneysider,29/04/2020,That‚Äôs a Fail! Downloaded the app no problems. Today I received a notification so I opened the app to see what it was. The notification said I had tested positive for COVID-19 and asked me to tick a box to consent to the release of my data. Lol. I haven‚Äôt even been tested let alone tested positive. Nor do I know anyone who has been tested. I searched around for a phone number to report the problem but all I could find was the Coronavirus hotline number. I called this number to report the problem but they didn‚Äôt have an answer. All they could do was give me an email address for app support. So if I wanted to report this problem I would have to send an email thus giving them more of my data. I just deleted the app instead. 
Wenchbags,29/04/2020,Interferes with mobile hot spot Mobile hot spot not available or interference while using this app forced me to delete it. 
Bonzo543,29/04/2020,Bluetooth connectivity Downloaded very straight forward. Having trouble with blue tooth as keeps disconnecting when phone goes to sleep.Allow Bluetooth remains off with no ability to switch this on via app. So don‚Äôt think my app is functioning. There is no real help/troubleshooting available for the app. So have given up. I did give high rating because the concept is good! 
FuzzBot123,30/04/2020,Unclear if ‚Äòopen‚Äô means foreground or don‚Äôt kill The Singapore version of this app requires it to be kept in the foreground and says that. This version says ‚Äòopen‚Äô and the minister has said it has fixed the problems that require foreground. Can we get an answer as to if it needs to be in the foreground to work? 
robdae,1/05/2020,Seems kinda pointless I understand the need for this app but it seems a little pointless. As I‚Äôm as hearing to the social distancing regulations the only people who I‚Äôm ever in contact with for more than 15 minutes are the people in my house. The most likely place I‚Äôm going to contact this virus is while shopping and the people I pass in the shops won‚Äôt be registered. The serving problem with it is Bluetooth which I need to remember to turn on when I leave the house but turn off at home or my phone automatically connects to random home devices. 
Andy987s,1/05/2020,Tried and uninstalled Whilst the app is an excellent idea the implementation leaves a lot to be desired. The daily ‚Äòalert‚Äô messages which are just advertising were distracting and annoying. I disabled alerts for the app and then the app said they are required. There is no explanation why and of course the government has gone back on its promise to open source the app and release an independent security audit report. So thanks but no thanks. 
raiden337,1/05/2020,Seriously held back by iOS As reported by News.com.au and within the app itself the app must be open with your screen turned on to track Contacts. I can‚Äôt leave my phone unlocked whilst I‚Äôm roaming public places as this is specifically the time I want my phone protected by security. The app constantly sends notifications asking to open the app and leave it in power save mode for your reference power save mode is when you open the app and place your phone either upside down or face down. I‚Äôm really sad that iOS users aren‚Äôt able to reliably do our part to help! 
prdaniels,2/05/2020,Possible glitch Great initiative but a possible glitch: when I‚Äôm streaming music over bluetooth to my wireless headphones I wonder if this app makes the music cut off periodically - it appears to disconnect the headphones entirely. As I‚Äôm quite a heavy user of these headphones unfortunately I can‚Äôt use the app at the same time. This issue with the music/headphones cutting out periodically (every 20mins or so? Sometimes more frequently) seemed to only begin when I‚Äôd installed the app. 
cmascord,2/05/2020,Interferes with hands free and other Bluetooth devices The app is simple enough to register but the Bluetooth keeps preventing my phone from pairing with hands free in car and other Bluetooth devices. I generally have to either shutdown the app or go into my phone settings every time I get in the car to pair with hands free. Not only is this annoying but could be a safety issue for people driving. 
Cenakhoa,4/05/2020,Bluetooth conflict with other accessories Thanks Australian government for your initiatives to get this application out. However when the app periodically use Bluetooth to check surrounding area already connected Bluetooth devices like headphones and speakers experienced light glitches or complete disconnection based on my testing. This could discourage people who commute/working by cars (connecting with Bluetooth in vehicles) or people who worked in professional service industry (who are always on Bluetooth headphones) to install the app 
LavenderJadeRose,4/05/2020,E I installed the app and as soon as I entered I went into where I upload information or something and it said I have Covid-19. I never got tested I don‚Äôt think. I had a blood test 2 days ago but for something else. Did the blood test pick it up?? 
LuckyAdam,5/05/2020,Well done to the devs .. from another developer Well done to the team that built the app. Battery drain is less than 1% per day (which was one of my initial concerns). Can‚Äôt wait to see the source code but bug free for me and privacy is spot on with what they have said all along. 
RHYS MUCCI,6/05/2020,Great app Please stop thinking the government is stealing your information. If you do you should probably see a doctor. Enough said. 
whosaid,6/05/2020,Annoyingly you have to keep the app running I don‚Äôt have any complaints except that you have to run the app constantly - it‚Äôs easy to accidentally close when closing other apps. 
Bobboooogf,7/05/2020,Doesn‚Äôt open I chose to say no to certain questions and now it doesn‚Äôt want to work. Obviously I don‚Äôt actually have any control over the app as the GOV said I did 
kajinoz,8/05/2020,Interferes with Bluetooth in other apps using Bluetooth I noticed poor audio in Bluetooth earphones when Covid19 is running on iPhone 7 
nitramluap,9/05/2020,Reasonable - bud need the proper API Due to the iPhone‚Äôs *very reasonable* privacy & battery limitations on developers this needs to use the upcoming Apple Exposure Notification API - and there is no excuse for it to not be ready the second iOS 13.5 drops as it‚Äôs been available to Developers for several weeks already. If they do NOT use the Apple API I shall be uninstalling this as it is totally pointless to require it to run in the foreground at all times. I‚Äôm not going to reward sloppy developers... so fingers crossed. 
daHarves,10/05/2020,15 minute contact is too long We‚Äôre hearing that this app hasn‚Äôt collected data yet. Until health authorities / the CMO acknowledges that COVID-19 can be spread with contact a LOT less than 15 minutes and remember that this is not the flu... This app needs a custom sensitivity setting. To allow me to set my own time between 1 and 15 minutes. The app is ineffective otherwise. Privacy concerns are also moot while the app isn‚Äôt sensitive enough and collect enough data. 
bluetooth question,11/05/2020,Will my hearing aid affect this app? I use Bluetooth to connect to my hearing aid on my iPhone. Does this limit the effectiveness of this app? 
Lapin426,15/05/2020,Useless app I was expecting to have information relating to where those confirmed cases are. But this app said nothing about that. Totally useless. 
Leasy1234567,18/05/2020,Interfere with Dexcom CGM diabetes app It caused my type one diabetes blood sugar monitoring app dexcom‚Äôs Bluetooth signal to drop out and didn‚Äôt alert me to my dangerous low blood sugar event. As soon as I deleted the app after hours of tying to get the signal back it magically reappeared. Be cautious CGM users! 
aer0033,18/05/2020,Disrupts Bluetooth connections App interferes with Bluetooth connection to other devices. My Phone now disconnects my Apple Watch multiple times a day. Only by turning Bluetooth on and off can I reconnect my watch. 
immitch,19/05/2020,Interferes with Apple Watch Unable to connect to my Apple Watch over Bluetooth after downloading the app. Can be fixed by toggling Bluetooth on/off and reconnecting daily. Very frustrating. 
Tempogogo,20/05/2020,Doing my bit but... The app interfered with my other Bluetooth devices if left running in background for more than an hour. It disconnected wireless headphones several times. It unpaired Apple Watch entirely that I had to reset and re-pair my watch.
