I know, I know. It's a little embarrassing that a static site generator didn't actually have a static site (or any site for that matter). In my defense, I've been working so hard on actually building the thing that getting a site up and running was a secondary concern. Well the embarrassment is over and Statiq now has a lovely information and documentation site (if I do say so myself).
