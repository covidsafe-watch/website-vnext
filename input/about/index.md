We are a team of security researchers, open-source advocates, community managers and privacy specialists that support the concept of technology based contact tracing.

* We want to see lives saved through the use of this unprecedented technology.
* It is crucial to us that privacy and security issues are addressed promptly and communicated in an inclusive and open manner.
* We believe transparency is essential to achieve both of these goals without compromising either. Compromising privacy risks peopleâ€™s lives by undermining public trust in the systems built to protect them.
* This can only be achieved by direct collaboration with engineers using transparent open source platforms as the UK National Health Service and German Ministry of Health.
* We advocate for direct collaboration with engineers using open source platforms just as the <a href="https://twitter.com/NHSX/status/1258453749691027465?s=19">UK National Health Service</a>, and the <a href="https://tcn-coalition.org/members/">TCN Coalition</a>.

# Jim Mussared

I'm a hybrid hardware and software developer, with current professional experience with open-source development and designing/developing BLE-based products for <a href="https://georgerobotics.com/">George Robotics</a>. Formerly worked in programming/electronics education at Grok Learning, and before that at Google Australia as a tech lead in the SRE team as well as some time working with the Android team.

My <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u5a5ersKBH6eG362atALrzuXo3zuZ70qrGomWVEC27U/edit">Bluetooth research</a> into contact tracing has received world wide praise.

# Richard Nelson

I'm a professional software engineer of 16 years, 8 of which have been in mobile app development and leadership. I have a strong interest in infosec, and my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sviVey1jCk97BACwkAJMctG8rFlC7Mf8pMpluW6VOQw/edit">research into the iPhone application background behaviour</a> identified a coding error as a contributing factor preventing COVIDSafe from working effectively. I discovered a remote bluetooth vulrunability (<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvekey.cgi?keyword=CVE-2020%E2%80%9312717">CVE-2020â€“12717</a>) in COVIDSafe that [redacted].
